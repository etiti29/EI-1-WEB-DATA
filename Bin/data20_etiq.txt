This is a quagmire, said one house member. There is no evidence whatsoever that Nazi Germany had any connection to the attacks of 12/07 and fighting with Germany is a distraction from our war on Japan. We need to finish the job in the Pacific before getting involved in Europe’s problem and besides, it’s not as if Nazi Germany is an imminent threat to America. They haven’t even been able to conquer Britain. Besides, isn’t this a matter for the League of Nations?  Asked about reports that there were some concentration camps in Europe, another House member replied, He [FDR] has never said that this was about liberating the concentration camps in his 12/08 speech. In fact, how could he [FDR] say a word about this when we ally ourselves with dictators such as Josef Stalin and Chang-Kai-Shek?  One Republican Senator opined that, FDR has squandered all the good will we built up from WW1 in a few short years and for what? So we can conquer Japan and Germany to acquire cheap radios and German automobiles. It’s about enriching FDR's Wall-Street buddies.  [Click here to view the complete article]",

All places with ball pits in the children's play area. One of my sons lost his watch, and was very upset. We dug and dug in those balls, trying to find his watch. Instead, we found vomit, food, feces, and other stuff I do not want to discuss. I went to the manager and raised hell. Come to find out, the ball pit is only cleaned out once a month. I have doubts that it is even done that often. My kids will never play in another ball pit. Some of you might not be parents, but you may have nieces, nephews, grandchildren, or friends with children. This will pertain to you too. As I read the following, my heart sank. I urge each and every one of you to pass this on to as many people as you can. I cannot stress how important this is! Hi. My name is Lauren Archer, my son Kevin and I lived in Midland,TN. On October 2nd, 1999 I took my only son to McDonald's for his 3rd birthday. After he finished lunch, I allowed him to play in the ball pit. When he started whining later on, I asked him what was wrong, he pointed to the back of his pull-up and simply said Mommy, it hurts. I couldn't find anything wrong with him at that time. I bathed him when we got home, and it was at that point when I found a welt on his left buttock. Upon investigating, it seemed as if there was something like a splinter under the welt. I made an appointment to see the doctor the next day, but soon he started vomiting and shaking, then his eyes rolled back into his head. From there, we went to the emergency room. He died later that night. It turned out that the welt on his buttock was the tip of a hypodermic needle that had broken off inside. The autopsy revealed that Kevin had died from a heroine overdose. The next week, the police removed the balls from the ball pit. There was rotten food, several hypodermic needles: some full, some used, knives, half-eaten candy, diapers, feces, and the stench of urine. (You can find the article on Kevin Archer in the October 10,1999 issue of the Midland Chronicle.) Repost this if it scares the crap out of you!! Repost this if you care about kids!! Please forward this to all loving mothers, fathers and anyone who loves and cares for children!! What has this world come to?? If a child is not safe in a child's play area then where??",

This is a new common gang initiation game going on the streets. The new member being initiated drives along without his headlights on until someone notices and flashes their headlights or makes some other action to signal him. The gang member is now required to chase the car and to shoot at or into the car in order to complete his initiation requirements. Please take this seriously. This is not a joke.

Obama bucked tradition of Nixon who attended MG Dillard's funeral in 1970 & Bush who attended LTG Maude's in 2001.     Back on August 5th, Major General Harold Greene was killed in Afghanistan, the victim of an insider attack. He was the first general killed in a combat zone since the Vietnam War.  Insider attacks are on the rise in Afghanistan, as tens of thousands of Taliban and Al-Qaeda fighters have infiltrated the Afghan National Security Forces.  Such a rare occurrence as a high-ranking officer's death should have warranted a great deal of attention from our Commander-in-Chief, but Obama has yet to make any public comments regarding his death. Not only has Obama been unable to make any comment about the General's sacrifice, he also was unable to find the time to make it to General Greene's funeral, held in Arlington National Cemetery. Obama himself was conspicuously absent, but so were the Vice President and the Secretary of Defense. The highest ranking and most senior member of Obama’s administration that found the time to pay respects to the General that was murdered by the enemy was Army Chief of Staff Ray Odierno.  This is beyond outrageous, and should be taken as a blatant slap in the face of every military member and civilian that knows and understands the tradition, honor, and respect that comes with military service. In what can only be a gross oversight, or else a belligerent middle-finger, Obama hasn't even ordered flags to be flown at half-staff, like he did for the deaths of singer Whitney Houston, as well as the former communist and South African President Nelson Mandela.  There are no words to describe the amount of disrespect that was on display by Obama’s deliberate absence from the General's funeral.",

La divulgation résulte d’une action judiciaire, intentée par l’association contre le NIST, une agence gouvernementale en possession, jusqu’alors exclusive, de ces archives audiovisuelles.C’est ainsi que, via des centaines de DVDs, plus de 3000 gigabytes de photos et de vidéos, pour la plupart inédites, ont été obtenues en vertu de la loi sur la liberté d’information (Freedom of Information Act). La chaîne ABC avait effectué la même démarche, l’an dernier, à l’encontre du NIST avant d’obtenir un lot de 2279 photos prises par les policiers new-yorkais. La publication de ces nouveaux documents a démarré dimanche dernier sur la page Youtube du Centre. A ce jour, quatorze vidéos sont d’ores et déjà consultables. Il s’agit soit de séquences totalement inédites, soit d’extraits déjà diffusés ailleurs mais comprenant un meilleur son. Parmi ceux-ci, certains semblent avoir été altérés par le NIST avant d’être remis au Centre : par exemple, le passage visuel ou sonore de l’amorce de l’effondrement du WTC7, la troisième tour à s’être écroulée ce jour-là, fait défaut.",

Isn't it amazing that George Carlin - comedian of the 70's and 80's - could write something so very eloquent... and so very appropriate.  A Message by George Carlin:  The Paradox of our Time  The paradox of our time in history is that we have taller buildings, but shorter tempers wider freeways, but narrower viewpoints.  We spend more, but have less we buy more, but enjoy it less.  We have bigger houses and smaller families more conveniences, but less time  We have more degrees, but less sense more knowledge, but less judgment more experts, but more problems more medicine, but less wellness.  We drink too much, smoke too much, spend too recklessly, laugh too little, drive too fast, get too angry too quickly, stay up too late, get up too tired, read too seldom, watch TV too much, and pray too seldom.  We have multiplied our possessions, but reduced our values.  We talk too much, love too seldom, and hate too often.  We've learned how to make a living, but not a life we've added years to life, not life to years.  We've been all the way to the moon and back, but have trouble crossing the street to meet the new neighbor.  We've conquered outer space, but not inner space.  We've done larger things, but not better things.  We've cleaned up the air, but polluted the soul.  We've split the atom, but not our prejudice.  We write more, but learn less.  We plan more, but accomplish less.  We've learned to rush, but not to wait.  We build more computers to hold more information to produce more copies than ever, but have less communication.  These are the times of fast foods and slow digestion tall men, and short character steep profits, and shallow relationships.  These are the times of world peace, but domestic warfare more leisure, but less fun more kinds of food, but less nutrition.  These are days of two incomes, but more divorce of fancier houses, but broken homes.  These are days of quick trips, disposable diapers, throw-away morality, one-night stands, overweight bodies, and pills that do everything from cheer to quiet, to kill.

Pensez, employer un mot hébreu *1 dans une classe de France… Rendez-vous compte, utiliser un hébraïsme, un mot choisi par les Juifs eux-mêmes pour désigner un phénomène les concernant, pour qualifier une action d’ État encore inconnue jusqu’alors dans l’histoire humaine, à savoir : quatre années de traque quotidienne d’une population toute entière, les pauvres comme les riches, les riches autant que les pauvres, les femmes et les enfants autant que les hommes, les vieillards et les moribonds autant que les jeunes et les biens portant, puis deux de ces quatre années pendant lesquelles on choisira de privilégier, sur les trains de munitions et de troupes fraiches, les convois destinés à remplir la chambre à gaz d’Auschwitz. Les témoignages écrits laissés et retrouvés, des ghettos « transférés » et « transportés », disent : ces moribonds exécutés dans leur lit de mort, ces paralytiques jetés d’une fenêtre avec leur fauteuil, ces gamins faméliques tués d’une balle dans la tête, sans autre forme de procès, parce qu’ils avaient ramené, ces « rats », un peu de provisions, depuis la ville polonaise contiguë, pour que leur famille affamée tienne encore quelques jours. Quatre années d’enfermement sans vivre, quatre années de souffrances multiples, de fusillades, quatre années d’arrestations et de déportations- pour finir enfermés entre des miradors et des barbelés électrifiés, mis en esclavage, « nourri » de soupe claire ou d’épluchures de patates, pour travailler quelques temps pis qu’un forçat et mourir d’épuisement, ou pour être directement envoyés à la chambre à gaz. Rien de très spécifique donc, rien qu’un « génocide » comme un autre, pensaient nos deux braves bougres d’inspecteurs, étouffant d’impatience devant l’inconvenance partiale de l’enseignante. Ils ne le lui firent pas dire deux fois. On connaît la suite Depuis, de l’eau a coulé, sous le pont de l’édifice scolaire vermoulu, qui prend eau de partout et menace de s’effondrer. L’école poursuit néanmoins à « s’ouvrir sur la vie ». Apprendre l’arithmétique, faire les quatre opérations de base, pfu !! Quelle importance ? Les enfants n’ont-ils pas tous une calculette, pourquoi leur embarrasser l’esprit avec les tables de multiplication ?Apprendre l’histoire du pays ? Quel intérêt, puisque le pays est destiné à être dissout, coûte que coûte, dans cette extraordinaire « Europe » de l’euro et de la bureaucratie bruxelloise qui sait tout sur tout et décide de tout pour tout. Essayons donc d’inventer une « Histoire » globale. Venez au fait, va-t-on me dire. Où voulez vous en venir ? Où je veux en venir ? S’il est devenu sectaire, « communautariste » même, d’employer un mot hébreu, Shoah, pour désigner la mise à mort planifiée et industrialisée de toute une population, les Juifs de tous les pays, par toute la machinerie étatique d’une nation, l’Allemagne, et par l’association à cette besogne de mise à mort des structures policières et économiques des États conquis et soumis par celle-ci, -extermination à laquelle se sont volontairement associés le Mufti Husseini et ses acolytes-, il n’est pas du tout sectaire, il n’est pas du tout communautariste… « D’imprégner » les enfants scolarisés, aux senteurs et aux émotions spirituelles de l’islam. C’est recommandé, même. C’est l’ouverture, bien comprise, sur la « diversité » et sur « l’interculturalité ». C’est ainsi que les élèves de classe de 5ème du collège Saint-Pierre des Essarts de la Roche sur Yon ont été emmenés visiter une mosquée. C’est ainsi aussi qu’après un échange avec un monsieur Ali Ben Saada, aumônier près d’une maison d’arrêt, on les a fait se mettre en position de prière, sur les tapis prévus à cet effet… On se demandera peut-être : comment aurait réagi les élèves et les parents d’élèves musulmans si on les avait emmenés dans une église ou une synagogue et qu’on leur ait demandé de s’y mettre en position de prière chrétienne ou juive, après ou avant avoir échangé avec le Pasteur, le Rabbin ou le Curé? On connaît tous la réponse : Quelques véhicules et des poubelles de la Roche-sur-Yon auraient spontanément pris feu… des imams saoudiens, tunisiens, égyptiens, auraient prononcé des discours belliqueux. Ces hommes de religion de paix auraient dénoncé l’entreprise « américano-sioniste », visant à lutter contre l’islam, en cherchant hypocritement, par la ruse, à provoquer « l’apostasie », à favoriser la conversion de jeunes musulmans à une autre religion que la « vraie ».Que va-t-il se passer ?L’administration centrale du ministère, l’inspection générale, les « syndicats » d’enseignants, que vont-il faire ? Que vont dire, les uns et les autres ?Vont-ils crier au scandale, vont-ils s émouvoir de la grossière violation de la liberté de conscience, celle de jeunes collégiens vendéens ? Vont-ils dénoncer la démolition, consciente ou inconsciente, de la laïcité qui est un des moyens pour la garantir ?A l’inverse, FSU et tutti quanti, administration centrale, ministère, médias, vont-ils trouver tout à fait convenable une honteuse besogne d’endoctrinement religieux ?Vont-ils même en féliciter les auteurs, comme étant d’audacieux précurseurs de la nouvelle laïcité parfumée à l’interculturalité, favorisant « la diversité » et le nouveau « vivre ensemble »?Comme je le disais plus haut, on pourrait parler d’information concernant  le phénomène religieux, on pourrait parler de parcours scolaire neutre et non d’endoctrinement, si… si les mêmes élèves étaient emmenés, dans les mêmes conditions, dans une église, un temple, une synagogue, à une réunion de l’union des athées ou visiter le grand-orient ou un autre ordre franc-maçon, etc. Nous connaissons tous la réponse de tous ceux que nous évoquions : vous n’y pensez pas ! Il ne s’agit pas de donner des informations neutres et pluralistes, il s’agit seulement du « vivre ensemble » et de « l’interculturel ». Il ne s’agit que de connaître, pour les jeunes chrétiens et/ou athées, ce qui fait foi, et loi absolue s’imposant à la conscience de leurs condisciples ou voisins musulmans. Il ne s’agit que de se mettre en situation, pour mieux comprendre et admettre de laisser l’espace revendiqué par leurs émotions et croyances… Par contre, inviter les jeunes voisins et les condisciples musulmans a s’informer et à se mettre eux aussi en situation de comprendre ce qui amène l’émotion religieuse chrétienne, bouddhiste, juive, ou la conviction irréligieuse, ah ça, vous n’y pensez pas ! Ce serait les offenser. Ce serait aussi les « stigmatiser », les discriminer, puisque leur culture, qu’il faudrait « religieusement » respecter, -sans quoi on serait raciste-, ne les autorise pas à s’intéresser à des données non-religieuses ou religieuses autres. Ce serait de l’impérialisme culturel. Ce serait du pur et simple et ignoble… néocolonialisme !! En d’autres termes et pour résumer : Selon que vous serez imam ou autre chose, curé, rabbin, frère trois points, vous serez déclarés : innocent ou coupable, vous aurez ou vous n’aurez pas le droit « d’imprégner » les enfants scolarisés de vos croyances ou de vos convictions. Quand même, mes concitoyens et concitoyennes, vous ne trouvez pas que cela commence à faire beaucoup, trop même ? 1789 avait répondu à la problématique de Jean de La Fontaine. Faudra-t-il nous aussi attendre quatre vingt ans, avant de briser le système oppressif que certains mettent en œuvre aujourd’hui pour liquider l’héritage de nos anciens ? *1 en 2011, on devrait plutôt parler de « l’inéducation antinationale ». En effet, pour ne pas offenser les croyances religieuses et autres des enfants de populations accueillies dans notre pays, le pouvoir scolaire, soutenu en cela par des « syndicalistes » de cette profession, débarrasse l’enseignement du « superflu » faisant perdurer d’éventuelles causes de gêne : Le français est devenu comme une survivance. On peut le parler et l’écrire comme on veut, ce serait sans importance. On peut donc cesser de se comprendre et la République « une et indivisible » doit devenir un souvenir d’une époque révolue destinée à l’oubli. L’ Histoire doit cesser d’être l’enseignement d’une chronologie précise d’événements politiques, de phénomènes sociaux et de découvertes scientifiques et d’innovation technologiques datées, pour devenir un fourre-tout idéologique, une mélasse « transverse ».  On ne devrait plus savoir qui étaient les deux hommes qui ont calculé la vitesse de la lumière, où, quand et comment, parce que l’on devrait ânonner que l’Europe et le monde doivent leurs connaissances et leur technologie à « Al Andalûs »  et à la religion mahométane. Pour ne pas choquer, Charles Martel n’a plus jamais arrêté les Arabes à Poitiers. Après ce non-événement de 732, il n’y a plus eu deux siècles de guerres locales et de dévastations, dans les régions méridionales du pays, guerres résultant des actions de brigandages, pillardes et esclavagistes, des débris des armées djihadistes. On ne saura donc plus, on ne devra plus savoir, et c’est un ordre, -ouverture à la diversité oblige-, pourquoi il existe en France un massif des maures. On parlera de l’esclavage, mais seulement pour fustiger le colonialisme européen qui y mit fin. On parlera d’empires africains, mais on ne dira pas qu’ils furent impactés et profondément remaniés par la conquête arabo-musulmane de l’Afrique. On ne devra surtout pas dire aux élèves, qui pourraient en être choqués : que ces empires africains deviendront des organisations « étatiques » de courtiers, à base essentiellement clanique, des organisations de courtiers militaro-esclavagistes vendant de la chair humaine noire aux razzieurs arabes, puis aux négociants européens. On ne devra surtout pas dire que le Soudan de Khartoum  reste, en 2011, une vaste plaque tournante négrière et l’héritier de cette terrible époque.  Beaucoup d’autres choses devront désormais disparaître des livres et des cours d’Histoire, et surtout ne pas s’y inviter… Si l’on avait dû suivre le raisonnement tortueux de nos deux pandores déguisés en inspecteurs contrôlant le contenu et les méthodes de l’enseignement : en donnant un cours d’Histoire abordant les deux révolutions russes, il aurait fallu prohiber le mot soviet pour le remplacer par conseil. Comme le mot hébreu shoah, le mot russe, soviet, est passé dans toutes les langues. Pratiquement toutes les langues connaissent et disent « soviet », lorsqu’elles veulent parler d’une forme particulière de représentation élue et révocable, d’abord organisation d’ouvriers, puis de paysans et de soldats , elles distinguent, à juste titre, cette représentation d’autres qui s’en approchent mais présentent des différences et n’ont pas exactement le même contenu ni les mêmes effets sur la société. Le mot République lui-même…",

Reliable word also has it that BofA bank branches received a shipment of signs last week, reading We're sorry, but due to circumstances beyond our control, we cannot be open at this time.  This raises the likelihood of a ONE WEEK LONG bank holiday coming soon.

Don't be surprised to see a naked woman walking out of a shopping mall restroom: The latest scam being perpetrated in our nations shopping malls is not the cost of gourmet ice cream cones or Harry Potter collectible figurines. With what is being called amazing regularity, victims of this new crime wave have been found walking out of shopping mall restrooms completely naked. This has almost always been done by men to women, with a few exceptions. The way the scam works is, a man slips into a women's restroom and sneaks into a stall. He waits until there is only one woman in the restroom in a neighboring stall. The criminal then stands on the toilet and points a hand gun into the next stall, demanding the woman's valuables. After getting her cash and jewelry, he demands that she remove all of her clothing and kick them out of the stall. The th! ief tosses the clothing into a shopping bag, hangs an out of order sign on the restroom door, and slips back into the mall. The out of order sign ensures no one will soon come to the woman's rescue. It usually takes an hour or two for the woman to work up the nerve to leave the restroom in the nude, giving the criminal ample time to make his get away. The woman is left naked and humiliated in a mall full of strangers.  The best defense, say police, is to never go into a shopping mall restroom alone, as only women who are by themselves are targeted. PLEASE FORWARD THIS TO EVERYONE YOU KNOW. This has so far been a nearly perfect crime, as none of the perpetrators have been caught. Don't let this happen to another woman. ",

As most of you know, I live in Alexandria, but I work in Lafayette where I stay with friends when I'm there.  As you know from America's Most Wanted TV program as well as the news media, there is a serial killer in the Lafayette area. I just want to let you know about an incident that happened to me a few weeks ago that could have been deadly.  At first I didn't go to the police or anyone with it because I didn't realize how serious this encounter was. But since I work in a jail and I told a few people about it, it wasn't long before I was paraded into Internal Affairs to tell them my story.  It was approximately 5:15 am in Opelousas, La. I had stayed with a friend there and I was on my way to work. I stopped at the Exxon/Blimpie station to get gas. I got $10 gas and a Diet Coke... I took into the store two $5 bills and one $1 bill. (just enough to get my stuff)  As I pulled away from the store, a man approached my truck from the back side of the store (an unlit area). He was an approachable-looking man (clean cut, clean shaven, dressed well, etc.) He walked up to my window and knocked. Since I'm very paranoid and always looking for the rapist or killer, I didn't open the window.... I just asked what he wanted. He raised a $5 bill to my window and said You dropped this. Since I knew I had gone into the store with a certain amount of money.... I knew I didn't drop it. When I told him it wasn't mine.... he began hitting the window and door and screaming at me to open my door and that I had dropped the money! At that point, I drove away as fast as I could.  After talking to the Internal Affairs department and describing the man I saw and the way he escalated from calm and polite to angry and volatile.... it was determined that I could have possibly encountered the serial killer myself. At this point, it is unclear as to how he gains access to his victims since there has been no evidence of forced entry into homes, etc. And the fact that he has been attacking in the daytime when women are less likely to have their guard up... and what gesture is nicer than returning money to someone that dropped it????? How many times would you have opened your window (or door) to get your money and say thank you.... because if the person is kind enough to return something to you...then he can't really be a threat.... can he????  Please be cautious! This might not have been the serial killer... it probably wasn't... but anyone that gets that angry over someone not accepting money from them, can't have honorable intentions.   ",

        "tweet": "[Collected via e-mail, January 2009] Washington, DC - President Barack Obama and the Democrat controlled Congress is considering sweeping legislation that will provide new benefits for many Americans. The Americans With No Abilities Act. AWNAA is being hailed as a major legislative goal by advocates of the millions of Americans who lack any real skills or ambition.  'Roughly 50 percent of Americans do not possess the competence and drive necessary to carve out a meaningful role for themselves in society,' said California Senator Barbara Boxer. 'We can no longer stand by and allow People of Inability to be ridiculed and passed over. With this legislation, employers will no longer be able to grant special favors to a small group of workers, simply because they have some idea of what they are doing.'  In a Capitol Hill press conference, House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid pointed to the success of the U.S. Postal Service, which has a long-standing policy of providing opportunity without regard to performance. Approximately 74 percent of postal employees lack any job skills, making this agency the single largest U.S employer of Persons of Inability.  Private-sector industries with good records of non-discrimination against the Inept include retail sales (72%), the airline industry (68%), and home improvement 'warehouse' stores (65%). At the state government level, the Department of Motor Vehicles also has an excellent record of hiring Persons of Inability (63%).  Under The Americans With No Abilities Act, more than 25 million 'middle man' positions will be created, with important-sounding titles but little real responsibility, thus providing an illusory sense of purpose and performance.  Mandatory non-performance-based raises and promotions will be given so as to guarantee upward mobility for even the most unremarkable employees. The legislation provides substantial tax breaks to corporations that promote a significant number of Persons of Inability into middle-management positions, and gives a tax credit to small and medium-sized businesses that agree to hire one clueless worker for every two talented hires.  Finally, the AWNAA contains tough new measures to make it more difficult to discriminate against the non-abled, banning, for example, discriminatory interview questions such as, 'Do you have any skills or experience that relate to this job?'  'As a Non-abled person, I can't be expected to keep up with people who have something going for them,' said Mary Lou Gertz, who lost her position as a lug-nut twister at the GM plant in Flint , Michigan, due to her inability to remember 'rightey tightey, lefty loosey.' 'This new law should be real good for people like me,' Gertz added.  With the passage of this bill, Gertz and millions of other untalented citizens will finally see a light at the end of the tunnel.  Said Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL): 'As a Senator with no abilities, I believe the same privileges that elected officials enjoy ought to be extended to every American with no abilities. It is our duty as lawmakers to provide each and every American citizen, regardless of his or her inadequacy, with some sort of space to take up in this great nation and a good salary for doing so.",

The Bill (House Bill No. 1827) amends Title 75 of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statues and was passed on September 11, 2007.  The Bill states that No driver shall operate any moving vehicle on a highway of this Commonwealth, which shall include Federal, State and municipal highways, while using a handheld mobile telephone.  The term handheld mobile telephone is defined by the bill as:  A mobile telephone other than a hands-free mobile telephone with which a user engages in a call using at least one hand.  It also defines hands-free mobile telephone as follows:  A mobile telephone that has an internal feature or function, or that is equipped with an attachment or addition, whether or not permanently part of such mobile telephone, by which a user engages in a call without the use of either hand, whether or not the use of either hand is necessary to activate, deactivate or initiate a function of such telephone.  The new law does not apply, however to the following, when on duty and acting in their official capacities:  Law Enforcement Officers Operators of Emergency Vehicles The bill also mentions that defensible actions for the use of a handheld mobile telephone will be:  The driver had reason to fear for the driver's safety Reporting a traffic accident Making a 911 emergency call A person who is found to be in violation of this section commits a summary offense and upon conviction, will be sentenced to pay a $50 fine.",

He told me that within the last 24 hours, more than 30 Ryder, U-Haul, and Verizon trucks have been reported stolen across the country. The U-Haul and Ryder trucks were rented and then never returned, so they're considered stolen.  Many of them were rented by people of Arab descent. I don't mean to make any assumptions, and I certainly don't want to scare you, but I thought you all might like to know. Be wary of these vehicles, pay attention to them, and don't walk or park near them. He said to stay out of major public places if at all possible (Crossgates, the Pepsi, downtown Albany, etc.) because recreational sites would most likely be hit on weekends.  I'm sorry to cause alarm, but he told me it was OK to share this information. If you'd like to forward it to anyone you know, feel free, as there is a possibility it might save lives. I hope everyone is doing well, and give those you love an extra hug.",

It's time to move away from the failed policies of the past, said Obama during a Rose Garden press conference, and the first step is apologizing for the original sin of this nation against the sensibilities of the international community.  The Declaration of Independence from the wise and benevolent guiding hand of Great Britain was, in the eyes of some, an important step, said Obama. But the  manner in which it was handled was an affront to acceptable diplomatic norms. This crude and disparaging document heaped numerous, undeserved insults on the divine ruler of our compassionate and nurturing motherland. It used such crass and dispicable terms as 'tyrant' and 'despot' to describe the gracious tolerance of King George the Third to the aspersions and indignities heaped upon him by a cabal of ungrateful rebels.  Therefore, declared Obama, we, the people of the United States of America, do formally apologize and ask for the forgiveness of the descendants and heirs of Great Britain's people and monarchy.  Reaction to the apology was mixed.  Vice President Joe Biden said the apology was a good start, but noted that if we really wanted to make amends for 233 years of disloyalty, America would have to show our sincerity with deeds, not words.  If we really want to make up with Great Britain, said Biden, we need to become more like them. We should adopt their health care system. And their ban on guns. And their ban on knives. Man, I hate knives — I cut myself on one last time I was in my secret undisclosed location under the old U.S. Naval Observatory — hey, this is off the record, right?  Queen Elizabeth the Second said that she would consider accepting the apology if Obama would take back this stupid iPod and send me a Kindle 2.",

        "tweet": "Comment: I recieved the email below and want to know if it is truely from Paul Allen or not:  Paul Allen's Editorial on the Mormons. Paul Allen is the owner of the Seattle Seahawks. He is also the owner of the Portland Trail Blazers NBA basketball team and is a co-partner with Bill Gates in Microsoft. His letter to the editor was published in the Santa Clarita, California newspaper. Editor:  I have heard and seen enough!  I have lived in the West all my life. I have worked around them. They have worked for me and I for them. When I was young, I dated their daughters. When I got married they came to my wedding. Now that I have daughters of my own, some of their boys have dated my daughters. I would be privileged if one of them were to be my son-in-law.  I'm talking about the Mormons.  They are some of the most honest, hard-working people I have ever known. They are spiritual, probably more than most other so-called religious people I have encountered. They study the Bible and teach from it as much as any Christian church ever has. They serve their religion without pay in every conceivable capacity. None of their leaders, teachers, counselors, Bishops or music directors receive one dime for the hours of labor they put in. The Mormons have a non-paid ministry — a fact not generally known.  I have heard many times from the pulpits of others how evil and non-Christian they are and that they will not go to heaven. I decided recently to attend one of their services near my home to see for myself.  What a surprise! What I heard and saw was just the opposite from what the religious ministers of the day were telling me. I found a very simple service with no fanfare. I found a people with a great sense of humor and a well-balanced spiritual side. There was no loud music. Just a simple service, with the members themselves giving the several short sermons.  They urge their youth to be morally clean and live a good life. They teach the gospel of Christ, as they understand it. The name of their church is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Does that sound like a non-Christian church to you?  I asked them many questions about what they teach and why. I got answers that in most cases were from the New Testament. Their ideas and doctrines did not seem too far fetched for my understanding. When I read their Book of Mormon I was also very surprised to find just the opposite from what I had been told I would find.  Then I went to another church's pastor to ask him some of the same questions about doctrine. To my surprise, when he found out that I was in some way investigating the Mormons, he became hostile. He referred to them as a non-Christian cult. I received what sounded to me like evil propaganda against those people. He stated bluntly that they were not Christian and that they did not fit into the Christian mold. He also told me that they don't really believe the Bible. He gave me a pile of anti-Mormon literature. He began to rant that the Mormons were not telling me the truth about what they stand for. He didn't want to hear anything good about them.  At first I was surprised and then again, I wasn't. I began to wonder. I have never known of a cult that supports the Boy Scouts of America. According to the Boy Scouts, over a third of all the Boy Scout troops in the United States are Mormon.  What cult do you know of that has a welfare system second to none in this country? They have farms, canneries and cattle ranches to help take care of the unfortunate ones who might be down and out and in need of a little help. The Mormon Church has donated millions to welfare causes around the world without a word of credit. They have donated thousands to help re-build Baptist churches that were burned a few years ago. They have donated tons of medical supplies to countries ravaged by earthquakes.  You never see them on TV begging for money. What cult do you know of that instills in its members to obey the law, pay their taxes, serve in the military if asked and be a good Christian by living high moral standards?  Did you know that hundreds of thousands of Mormon youth get up before high school starts in the morning to attend a religious training class? They have basketball and softball leagues and supervised youth dances every month. They are recruited by the FBI, the State Department and every police department in the country because they are trustworthy. They are taught not to drink nor take drugs. They are in the Secret Service — those who protect the President. They serve in high leadership positions from both parties in Congress and in the U.S. Senate, and have been governors of several states other than Utah. They serve with distinction and honor.  If you have Mormons living near, you will probably find them to be your best friends and neighbors. They are Christians who try to live what they preach. They are not perfect and they are the first to admit this. I have known some of them who could not live their religion, just like many of us.  The rhetoric which is spread around against them is nothing more than evil propaganda founded in untruths. (Others) had successfully demonized them to the point that the general public has no idea what they actually believe and teach. If you really want to know the truth, go see for yourself. You, also, will be surprised.  When I first moved here some 25 years ago there were five Mormon wards in Santa Clarita. Now there are 15. They must be doing something right.

He's announced that since Mel Gibson is fueling the fires of anti-Semitism in the world with his movie about the last hours of Christ, Spielberg will make a graphic movie about the Crusades.  In order to get Jews and Moslems to convert to Christianity, Spielberg commented, Christians went through Europe and into the Middle East forcing conversions on non-believers. Along the way they raped, beat, bludgeoned, maimed, tortured and killed hundreds of thousands of innocent men, women and children. I will show Christian brutality in a realistic and most graphic and gory way.  Spielberg went on to add that the movie will have a well-deserved anti-Christian tone. Let's face it, Gibson wants to blame the Jews for the death of one person we didn't even kill. I will show the inhuman brutality of thousands of Christians against hundreds of thousands of people of other faiths, about which historically there is no ambiguity as to who is to blame.  Spielberg said that if this movie is successful, he is likely to follow it up with The Spanish Inquisition, a historical film on the torture and murder of the Jews of Spain by the Catholic Church. To complete the trilogy, Spielberg announced, in 2006 I will be filming Hitler and the Pope: A Team Formed in Hell. That should generate some heated debate.",

Called 'Operation Yellow Jacket', each Michigan State Police District has a truck cleaned up and ready to go! These trucks have specially modified engines that can virtually catapult the truck from snow-plow speed to intercept speed in seconds. And when the engine boost kicks in, the warning lights automatically change from flashing yellow to the dreaded red and blue! Starting March 1, 2009, Michigan will launch a 31 day speeding ticket frenzy. The state estimates that $9 million dollars will be generated in speeding tickets, with an additional $3.5 million in revenue for failure to wear a seatbelt. $1 million will go to pay state troopers overtime. There will be 47 state troopers on duty at all times patrolling the main intersections and highways with the highest rates of speeding. They are the following: I-75, especially from the Ohio line north to Woodhaven, and again from Auburn Hills to Flint I-96 east and west in its entirety I-275 north and south I-675 north and south I-94 east and west from Battle Creek to Jackson I-696 east and west in its entirety I-196 east and west US-131 north and south I-69 east and west from Lansing to Flint and again from Flint eastward to Port Huron. I-69 north and south from I-94 to Lansing M-14 east and west from I-94 to I-275 M-39 from I-94 to I-96 M-59, especially from Pontiac to Utica, and from Utica east US-10 from Midland to Bay City US-23 from I-96 to Flint US-27 from Lansing to Mt. Pleasant Quotas: 5 mph above the limit can justify a ticket and every state trooper is supposed to pull a car over and write a ticket every 10 to 20 minutes. They have issued 30 brand new unmarked Dodge Charger Police cruisers and canceled all vacation time. In addition, they are bringing in all of their part timers on full time for the month. This nonsense will conclude on April 1. Driving Ticket fine increase in MI: Starting on January 15th, the price of a ticket for violation of MI Law 39:3-29 (failure to show your driver's license, registration, or proof of insurance card at the time you are stopped) went from $44.00 to $173.00. Please make sure your vehicles have the proper documents in them. If you jump in the car to run to the store and forget your wallet with your license in it and you are stopped.... Oh well... you just spent $173. And the fine for not having all three documents is $519!!!",

They are all in 3 different schools. I also heard it from the interns at work.     Following is a rumor making the kids rounds lately. My daughter - 09 yrs old, in Nassau County, NY verifies it's truth as the story was corroborated by her cousin 11 from the Boston, MA area-reports:  Sponge Bob Square Pants is being cancelled. A three yr old, on a cruise ship w/ his parents, finishes breakfast and announces he is going to see Sponge Bob. His parents, thinking that he is going down to the cabin to watch TV agree that that is a good idea. The child proceeds to jump over the rail and drown in his attempt to visit Sponge Bob's who lives in a pineapple under the sea.",

I was just walking outside with the kids and was driving by and seen me so slammed on his breaks. It kind of freaked me out so everyone be carful for him he is in Lancaster right now. I was rude to him cause I read this post from someone else. He was over by Drayton this morning out in the country.ATTENTION FRIENDS IN THE GILBERT AREA (especially with kids): Last week two young slavic girls came to our house selling Children's books. They asked to come in and were very pushy. They interacted with Maximus for awhile and asked us a ton of questions. They had a binder full of names of families in the area and kept asking over and over for us to give them more names of kids in our neighborhood and surrounding area. They came back two days later again.Today I found out there is a scam of two women with heavy accents going door to door pretending to sell children's books but who are targeting young girls for sex trafficking. There have been abductions from this scam in other states. I spoke with Gilbert PD and they are already investigating. PLEASE CALL THE POLICE if these girls come to your door",

Many of the farmers and their family had contracted it and many died.  The doctor came upon this one farmer and to his surprise, everyone was very healthy. When the doctor asked what the farmer was doing that was different the wife replied that she had placed an unpeeled onion in a dish in the rooms of the home, (probably only two rooms back then). The doctor couldn't believe it and asked if he could have one of the onions and placed it under the microscope. She gave him one and when he did this, he did find the flu virus in the onion. It obviously absorbed the virus, therefore, keeping the family healthy.  Now, I heard this story from my hairdresser in AZ. She said that several years ago many of her employees were coming down with the flu and so were many of her customers. The next year she placed several bowls with onions around in her shop. To her surprise, none of her staff got sick. It must work.. (And no, she is not in the onion business.)  The moral of the story is, buy some onions and place them in bowls around your home. If you work at a desk, place one or two in your office or under your desk or even on top somewhere. Try it and see what happens. We did it last year and we never got the flu.  If this helps you and your loved ones from getting sick, all the better. If you do get the flu, it just might be a mild case..  Whatever, what have you to lose? Just a few bucks on onions!",

        "tweet": "The Arizona Highway Patrol were mystified when they came upon a pile of smoldering wreckage embedded in the side of a cliff rising above the road at the apex of a curve. The metal debris resembled the site of an airplane crash, but it turned out to be the vaporized remains of an automobile. The make of the vehicle was unidentifiable at the scene.  The folks in the lab finally figured out what it was, and pieced together the events that led up to its demise.  It seems that a former Air Force sergeant had somehow got hold of a JATO (Jet Assisted Take-Off) unit. JATO units are solid fuel rockets used to give heavy military transport airplanes an extra push for take-off from short airfields.  Dried desert lakebeds are the location of choice for breaking the world ground vehicle speed record. The sergeant took the JATO unit into the Arizona desert and found a long, straight stretch of road. He attached the JATO unit to his car, jumped in, accelerated to a high speed, and fired off the rocket. The facts, as best as could be determined, are as follows:  The operator was driving a 1967 Chevy Impala. He ignited the JATO unit approximately 3.9 miles from the crash site. This was established by the location of a prominently scorched and melted strip of asphalt. The vehicle quickly reached a speed of between 250 and 300 mph and continued at that speed, under full power, for an additional 20-25 seconds. The soon-to-be pilot experienced G-forces usually reserved for dog-fighting F-14 jocks under full afterburners.  The Chevy remained on the straight highway for approximately 2.6 miles (15-20 seconds) before the driver applied the brakes, completely melting them, blowing the tires, and leaving thick rubber marks on the road surface. The vehicle then became airborne for an additional 1.3 miles, impacted the cliff face at a height of 125 feet, and left a blackened crater 3 feet deep in the rock.  Most of the driver's remains were not recovered however, small fragments of bone, teeth, and hair were extracted from the crater, and fingernail and bone shards were removed from a piece of debris believed to be a portion of the steering wheel.",

        "tweet": "Aerospace Notebook: Dead Contractor Reports to Work  By JAMES WALLACE SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER REPORTER Contractors: A dedicated group of Engineers that circle the country seeking the next high paying job. Contractors rarely if ever receive pay for time not worked. They usually have very few benefits although some receive incentives such as holiday pay, Per Diem, and longevity bonuses. Diem is a daily tax free living expense paid to the contractor. Longevity Bonus is usually one weeks pay or other amount paid after an established period of time, normally on completion of one year...  Contractors are known for showing up for work sick and /or injured in order to collect the incentives that they depend on, or to get paid for overtime, which is one and a half times their hourly pay. Boeing has documented many instances where contractors have gone through extreme lengths in order to show up for work.  We have seen people do extraordinary things before, but nothing like this, said Randy Saseler, Boeing's vice president of engineering. I am sure this is a first. Contractor shows up to work dead. At 5:00AM Saturday morning (Jan. 29) Wanda Robertson, the wife of contractor Peter Robertson, rolled her dead husband into a Renton, WA, Boeing facility, using the dead man's badge in order to gain entrance. She entered the building before most staff show up for work.  I thought it was some kind of a joke, said former co-worker David Palmer. That coffin was in the corner for about a week we thought the company was setting up some sort of show. We just ignored it. Geez that was Peter?  Mrs. Robinson is facing charges of trespassing on Boeing property. According to a statement she filed with Renton police, Mr. Robertson was 1 week shy of collecting his longevity bonus he would also have forfeited his Per Diem payment. Mrs. Robertson said that since he was physically at work, Boeing must pay him. The kids and I really need that money.  We are educating ourselves about the legal aspects of this case. We have never had a case where a dead man continued to come to work. This is highly unusual. Obviously this woman is in need. We are considering paying her the money her husband would have received, as well as her husband's burial costs. We will however, add a clause in our contracts so that this does not happen again, Tim Clark, Boeing spokesman, recently told the industry publication Flight International magazine. We just do not want dead people thinking that they can or should continue to come to work.",

Is this an old picture from a Halloween party or something?     I received this photo in an email captioned White House Ball. Is this for real? Or is it a a photo some one has tampered with to make it look this way?     This picture was emailed with the comment: Sometimes I miss Barbara and Laura Bush — and Jackie Kennedy in her little a-line dresses with matching hat and gloves! Is it real or retouched?     Is this the Obamas' 'actual' wedding photo?     Is this photo real? I have my doubts. Below is the accompanying text to the attached photo, received 9/28/09.  This was sent to me by an old ex-neighbor who wound up being a White House photographer. She said that after the Ball some fashion critics suggested that the attire could be questioned by some and therefore a lid was put on all photographs. This one happened to make it to my email, however, and I’m passing it along to a few.    [Collected via e-mail, April 2010] Were you invited to this St. Patricks Day party?

According to this report, Strategic Missile Forces Command (SMF) notified both President Putin and the General Staff this past Tuesday (8 October) that at 01:58:11 GMT/UTC an atomic device was exploded in the seabed off the US Atlantic Ocean, barely 1,000 km (620 miles) from Charleston, causing a 4.5 magnitude earthquake measurement that SMF experts equate to being a 1-kiloton yield, which is equal to the power of 1,000 tons of TNT.",

The National Guard resources to be used to thwart the truckers will include rifle toting National Guardsmen called up from units that will be coming in from Maryland, Pennsylvania and Virginia.  They will use heavily armed National Guardsmen on foot and using trucks, jeeps and armored vehicles, which will be stationed at all entrance ramps to the Beltway to block incoming traffic starting early Friday morning.

Encore trois millénaires et il n’est pas exclu qu’ils conçoivent courage et honnêteté plutôt que pleutrerie et soumission. Alors, retour de joint ou réalité chimique d’une rencontre fortuite entre deux neurones orphelins affamés de survie ? Peu importe, c’est en tout cas avec la hardiesse du plus féroce Rantanplan que nos courageux héritiers de Kropotkine sont passés outre les querelles intestines sur le sujet pour affirmer, sur Facebook et sans trembler, leur statut de balances collabos. Bravo les gars, respect total, fallait vraiment en avoir pour se mettre minables à ce point sans sourciller. Faire fi des derniers récalcitrants au déshonneur en son propre camp, ignorer les miroirs qui se fendent de honte et tapiner pour les maîtres des lieux, même en taule avec Émile Louis, Gunter le Fister et DSK, ça impressionne, on reste un larbin vivant et on gagne le galon au prix de litres de vaseline. Quant à nous, camarades il est heure de faire amende honorable : on ne sera jamais à la hauteur pour baisser notre froc d’aussi haut.Le conglomérat du CV69, sorte de fourre-tout bordélique qui regroupe dans une non-organisation moult structures politiques, fameuses ou inconnues (la liste ici), a donc fait son coming-out pour révéler au grand jour son activité de délateur, espion de bas-étage, maître-chanteur et idiot utile du système nourricier. Comme il doit être agréable de se libérer d’un tel non-dit, d’avouer une pratique différente jusque là contrainte à des recoins obscurs et de montrer enfin à la face du monde le véritable kapo qui croupit en l’homme ! Frédéric Mitterrand lui-même nourrirait grande jalousie à la révélation d’un tel soulagement qu’aucune boîte de Smecta ne saurait endiguer solidement. Mais trêve de lyrisme laxatif et d’ode à la bravoure du repenti, car le tout est argumenté et parfaitement réfléchi. Le caftage est élaboré en deux points répertoriés, qui associent technique de la Stasi et vices d’avoués. Morceau choisi : « Oui, c’est vrai, nous collaborons avec la préfecture et les mairies de Lyon. Cette collaboration prend essentiellement deux aspects :- informatif : nous tâchons de regrouper le plus d’informations sur les militants d’extrême-droite à Lyon : photos, adresses, situation familiale et professionnelle. Nous partageons ces renseignements avec les autorités compétentes. -Juridique : la loi est un outil redoutable. Bien maniée, elle peut permettre de porter de rudes coups aux fascistes en exploitant les vides juridiques ou dépoussiérant des textes tombés en désuétude (normes de sécurité, etc.) » Le post termine en une sorte de rhétorique d’emphase menaçante envers quiconque refuserait la dénonciation, même Pol Pot en serait choqué : « Nous n’avons pas peur de nous salir les mains pour notre cause, n’en déplaise à certaines ! Nous invitons toutes les personnes soucieuses de lutter contre le fascisme à employer nos méthodes. N’hésitez pas à recueillir des informations sur les personnes suspectes : au travail, dans la rue et même en famille. Ensuite envoyez un courrier (vous n’êtes pas obligées de le signer) à votre commissariat d’arrondissement. » Ah ! Quel courage chevaleresque ! On se croirait à Camelot et ça nous rappelle les heures les plus claires de notre histoire ! Qu’attendez-vous pour balancer vos connards de parents qui connaissent par cœur deux vers et demi de la Marseillaise, vos salauds d’amis qui passent toutes leurs vacances en France ou ce louche voisin qui n’achète jamais de voitures de marque étrangère ? Vite, vite les cafards, antifa is watching you* ! Ni Dieu ni Maître sont dans un bateau, tous les deux tombent à l’eau, qu’est-ce qui reste ?Un gaucho collabo. Ruben Azahar",

Well, it's my turn to add to the list of emailers and here it is:  Some members of the Calhoun County Sheriff's Department, Michigan State Police, and other local agencies inside Calhoun County were working with Secret Service in the security of Mr. Obama. Mr. Obama's bus arrived in Battle Creek and pulled into the stadium area. Before Mr. Obama exited the bus, he has the Secret Service get off and tell all Law Enforcement personnel in uniform that they now have to stand behind the bus so Mr. Obama is not seen with anyone in a Law Enforcement uniform before he gets off or while in the public view.  So, everyone from MSP, Sheriff's Dept., and other agencies looks at each other for a second, go and stand behind the bus out of sight so Mr. Obama does not have to see, or been seen with, what to him is 'undesirables' since he refuses to be seen or even acknowledge Military or Law Enforcement.  At a time of war and terrorism in our world, this presidential candidate who is being protected by various branches of the military & law enforcement at the tax payers expense, refuses to acknowledge, be seen with, have in his photographed background, any type of Military or Law Enforcement in uniform.  But this is not in the media or headlines in the news. Why? I wonder what the story or media frenzy would be if it was Muslims, blacks, whites, Jews, or any other race, gender, religion, and/or occupation, that Mr. Obama refuses to be seen with or have around him.  Why would Law Enforcement branches make this up?  Law Enforcement traditionally has had more funding under Democrats.  Just food for thought leading up to November 4th.

        "tweet": "Cher ami, Voilà un scandale qui, s'il était connu d'un grand nombre de Français, ferait sans doute une onde de choc à travers tout le pays...Vous savez sans doute que le gouvernement a récemment publié un décret qui oblige chaque automobiliste à détenir dans sa voiture un éthylotest – enfin deux, l'un pour se tester en cas de doute, et l'autre à présenter aux gendarmes en cas de contrôle.Officiellement, le but est de lutter contre l'alcoolisme au volant. Tout le monde aimerait voir moins de drames sur la route liés à l'alcool, c'est incontestable. Mais je vais vous montrer qu'il s'agit de bien autre chose ici...L'affaire est tellement scandaleuse qu'il fallait absolument que je vous envoie un mail pour vous informer ! Alors, voilà ce qui se passe :En juillet, une association, I-Test se crée pour militer en faveur d'éthylotests obligatoires dans toutes les voitures. Ils interpellent le Ministre de l'Intérieur, Claude Guéant, et hop quelques mois plus tard le décret sort. La nouvelle infraction est créée, avec une amende de 17 euros à la clef.Quand on sait qu'il faut des années d'habitude pour obtenir quoi que ce soit quand on est une association, nous avons été saisis par cette rapidité !Vous le savez, ici à la Ligue de Défense des Conducteurs, nous enquêtons depuis plus de trois ans sur la répression routière – il ne nous a pas fallu longtemps pour découvrir le pot aux roses !Qui sont les membres de cette association ? S'agit-il, comme on aurait pu le croire, d'un collectif de familles qui ont perdu un proche sur la route à cause d'un chauffard qui avait trop bu ?Pas du tout : ce sont tout simplement... des fabricants d'ethylotests ! Le Président de l'association est chargé de mission chez Contralco, le plus grand fabricant d'éthylotests chimiques (les fameux ballons).Et là, il vient de réussir un coup de maître : assurer à sa boîte un marché 100 % garanti sur 38 millions de voitures !Le calcul est vite fait : 38 millions de voitures x 2 éthylotests à 1€ pièce = 76 millions d'euros garantis dès l'application du décret en juillet prochain.Mieux : le décret comporte une obligation de norme NF pour les éthylotests... norme que cette entreprise est la seule à avoir !Voilà : un marché juteux, 100 % garanti, qui va rapporter des millions à une grosse entreprise...... Et nous, on vient nous dire que c'est pour notre sécurité ? Et que si l'éthylotest venait à manquer dans notre boîte à gants, ce serait tellement grave qu'on devrait payer une amende ? Franchement, de qui se moque-t-on ?C'était déjà la même chose avec les radars : au départ ils sont venus nous dire que c'était pour notre sécurité, et il n'y avait pas de raison de ne pas y croire. Enfin, au début...Car vu les bénéfices colossaux que raflent maintenant, chaque année, les grandes entreprises qui installent et entretiennent les radars (plus de 200 millions d'euros par an, directement issus de vos PV), qui peut encore venir nous parler de sécurité ??Année après année, les pouvoirs publics tirent un peu plus sur la corde, en se disant que ça va passer, que les Français ne vont rien dire... Alors depuis 2003 et la mise en place des premiers radars vitesse, on a eu les radars feu rouge, les radars tronçon, les radars discriminants, les radars zones de chantier, les radars mobiles embarqués dans des véhicules en mouvement, etc... L'Etat fait rentrer de plus en plus d'argent, et la cagnotte des entreprises productrices de radars gonfle, gonfle...Ces entreprises sont devenues tellement puissantes que, désormais, elles ne se cachent même plus pour faire leurs magouilles : le fameux lobbyiste qui vient d'obtenir le marché du siècle, avant de se lancer dans le business de l'éthylotest, dirigeait une société de radars ! C'est même lui qui a vendu les premiers radars feu-rouge au gouvernement !Quelques entreprises bien placées veulent grossir facilement leur chiffre d'affaire sans prendre de risque, ils sollicitent les pouvoirs publics, lesquels nous jouent la carte de la sécurité routière, et hop le tour est joué, le business est installé, et vous êtes ses clients forcés.Comment en est-on arrivés là ? Tout simplement parce qu'à chaque fois qu'ils tiraient un peu plus sur la corde, aucune voix ne s'élevait assez fort pour que ça fasse scandale et que ça s'arrête.Mais tout cela n'a que trop duré : quel autre business vont-ils réussir à implanter demain ? L'éthylotest anti-démarrage obligatoire dans toutes les voitures (coût : 1000 euros par véhicule) ? Des boîtes noires comme dans les avions, ou la géolocalisation obligatoire ?Ne vous en faites pas pour eux : ils trouveront toujours un prétexte de sécurité routière pour donner mauvaise conscience à ceux qui voudraient contester.En vérité, c'est eux qui devraient avoir honte de leurs pratiques. Agiter sous le nez des gens des images horribles d'accidents, profiter du deuil des familles des victimes, pour engraisser un business juteux, ce sont des pratiques inqualifiables ! Mais tant que des millions de Français ne leur auront pas fait savoir à quel point ils sont indignés, rien ne les arrêtera.Notre atout, en tant que simples citoyens, c'est que les élections approchent et qu'aucun candidat ne peut se permettre d'ignorer la colère de plusieurs millions de Français. Nous devons mettre, sur chacun des candidats en campagne, une pression telle que le Président qui sortira des urnes n'aura pas d'autre choix que de faire cesser ces pratiques honteuses. Nous devons agir dès maintenant, c'est pourquoi je vous demande de faire deux choses simples mais essentielles :--- Signez la pétition aux candidats que vous trouverez sur ce lien. Dans quelques jours, je veux pouvoir amener à chaque candidat plusieurs centaines de milliers de signatures, puis le double la semaine prochaine, et encore plus la semaine suivante, pour leur coller une telle pression avant l'élection qu'ils ne pourront pas l'oublier une fois élus ,--- M'aider à faire connaître ce scandale au plus grand nombre de Français possible, en transférant ce message à tous vos amis, vos proches, ou vos collègues. Ne les laissez pas tomber dans le piège de la propagande des pouvoirs publics qui utilisent la sécurité routière comme un alibi pour engraisser un business juteux. Je vous remercie.Bien cordialement, Christiane BayardSecrétaire GénéraleLigue de Défense des ConducteursLIGUE DE DEFENSEDES CONDUCTEURSStop à la répression absurdeOui à une conduite responsable116, rue de Charenton 75012 PARIS",

Cole, Chairman Center for Automotive Research (CAR). You have all likely heard CAR quoted, or referred to in the auto industry news lately.  Mr. Cole, who is an engineer by training, told many stories of the difficulty of working with the folks that the Obama administration has sent to save the auto industry. There have been many meetings where a 30+ year experience automotive expert has to listen to a newcomer to the industry, someone with zero manufacturing experience, zero auto industry experience, zero business experience, zero finance experience, and zero engineering experience, tell them how to run their business.  My favorite story is as follows:  There was a team of Obama people speaking to Mr. Cole (Engineer, automotive experience 40+ years, Chairman of CAR). They were explaining to Mr. Cole that the auto companies needed to make a car that was electric and liquid natural gas (LNG) with enough combined fuel to go 500 miles so we wouldn't need so many gas stations (A whole other topic). They were quoting BTUs of LNG and battery life that they had looked up on some website.  Mr. Cole explained that to do this you would need a trunk FULL of batteries and a LNG tank at big as a car to make that happen and that there were problems related to the laws of physics that prevented them from...  The Obama person interrupted and said (and I am quoting here) These laws of physics? Who's rules are those, we need to change that. (Some of the others wrote down the law name so they could look it up) We have the congress and the administration. We can repeal that law, amend it, or use an executive order to get rid of that problem. That's why we are here, to fix these sort of issues.  I feel so much better. I understand that Senator Isaac Newton is sponsoring Senate Bill Number 3.14.... to correct this errant package of laws preventing us from saving the world from the combustion engine.",

        "tweet": "You will pay upkeep/Secret Service for 5 Kerry mansions.  It is good to be John F. Kerry....... The F stands for Forbes in case you ever wondered.  He is one of the richest Senators in Government. When someone is elected president, it means the Secret Service has to protect the President and his family as well as his property.  The Kerry's have five US properties not counting the several foreign properties they own too. The cost to run these homes are more than what the average American could afford, even if the rent was free, and all you had to pay the water, gas & electric. Including ground keepers, maintenance, pool, and house keepers. To be President would require the taxpayers to pay for all that now if elected. Including a complete staffed Secret Service security 24 hours a day. In addition to that we will have to pay for each of their homes for security improvements even if they never go to them all there is that just in case. Who do you think will pay for all this? We Pay!  This takes all the expense off Kerry and puts it on us. Nevertheless, factor another major cost to Americans that Kerry does not want you to know about.  Becoming president would automatically include taking care of all their properties with Secret Service Agents that includes 5 agents per 6 hour shift 4 times a day 365 days of the year for the rest of their lives so long as they own those properties. It comes with being President once you are elected. It requires us the taxpayers, to pay for this as well as his annual salary as well as his retirements including the cost of living adjustments to boot.  These salaries and agents protect all their real estate property with Secret Service Agents and pay the bills for the rest of his life.  In addition, feed the Secret Service Agents and rotate new ones every 6 hours for the rest of his life.  Do the math. Five properties need to be protected. This requires five Secret Service Agents per shift, daily every six hours, per property! That is 20 Secret Service Agents per day per property everyday including Holidays. Wow, what does that cost?  Lets say an average of 20 agents per property, each earning a about $60K per agent to survey the perimeters and protect. Now times that by five properties so far. That is if the Kerry's do not buy any more properties afterwards. This also includes the Agents vehicles and repairs, gas, meals, days off, paid vacation, and medical plan visits etc per agent.  Who pays? YOU pay, the whole time they are alive after becoming President! Is this the best use of our tax money electing Kerry to take care of all their properties both foreign and domestic? On the other hand, shouldn't he pay for his own? Yet, the Presidential salary could not afford it.  The more I think about paying for Kerry's properties everyday, just makes me happy keeping President Bush all the more merrier. Without raising taxes to boot.  How on earth would Kerry pay for everyone to have Healthcare, increase our military, and have us pay to protect his investments, all without raising our taxes? Tax and spend Kerry is his party motto.  Which really has to make you wonder why anyone with his wealth, would take a salary of that of a U.S. Senator, never mind wanna be President? Do you believe him now why he needs to be the Prez? To serve the people? On the other hand, the people serve Him and his wife!  IF YOU AREN'T COMPLETELY APPALLED, THEN YOU HAVEN'T BEEN PAYING ATTENTION",

In case you don't know who he is, Homer was a poor West Virginia miner's son who worked his way up to being an employee/scientist for NASA. He wrote a book called Rocket Boy which was later made into a great movie called October Sky.  This morning he was interviewed and said this, about the one-shot shootdown of the crippled satellite:  If this country's head was on straight, they would be holding a ticker-tape parade for the crew of the Cruiser, USS Lake Erie.  This one rocket firing boosted our national defense 100-fold. North Korea, Iran, China, Russia, all know now that we have a safety net that can accurately stop their incoming missiles even if they are out of the earth's atmosphere.  Of course that was the plan all along, and it was a dandy plan.  I just hope that the next person in the White House doesn't scrap the system and begin baking cookies for the enemy.  Hilly or the Muslim Lawn Jockey will do just that and that makes me a little nervous.  At any rate, Kudos to the Officers and Crew of the USS Lake Erie.  WELL DONE, BLUE JACKETS!",

Obama to Launch America Scouts  In an advance copy received by World Net Daily, it appears that the President's new administration is going to try a bold new approach regarding the nation's youths. President Obama's staff is furiously working to finish the first draft of a new youth program, which would rival the traditional boy scouts.  Known as the America Scouts, these programs would be announced on March 1 of this year and the program would begin building a skeleton during the summer. On August 4, or Obama's 48th birthday, the program would begin accepting children between the ages of 4 and 18.  While the exact specifications of the program are either secret or yet to be established, it is believed that there will be three classes of scouts. Liberty scouts for children betweeen 4-8. Patriot scouts for those between 8-12 and Constitution scouts for those up to 18. It is yet unknown if these Constitution Scouts would then move up to President Obama's planned civilian reserve force.  [Rest of article here.]",

After you finish reading this, please forward this story on to others so that our nation and around the world will know about those who laughed when they found out about the tragic events in New York, PA and the Pentagon.  September 11th, a Budweiser employee was making a delivery to a convenience store in a town called McFarland. He knew of the tragedy that had occurred in New York. He entered the business to find two Arabs whooping and hollering and really cheering it up. It was obvious they were elated with what had happened earlier. The Budweiser employee went to his truck, called his boss and told him of the very upsetting event. He didn't feel he could be in that store with those horrible people. His boss told him, Do you think you could go in there long enough to pull every Budweiser product and item our beverage company sells there? We'll never deliver to them again.  The employee walked in, proceeded to pull every single product his beverage company provided and left with an incredible grin on his face. He told them never to bother and call for a delivery again.  Budweiser happens to be the beer of choice for that community. Just letting you all know how Kern County handles this situation!! [And now the rest of the story: It seems that the Bud driver and the Pepsi man are neighbors. Bud driver called Pepsi driver and told him. Pepsi called his boss who told him to pull all Pepsi products as well!! That would include Frito Lay, etc. Furthermore, word spread and all vendors followed suit!  At last report, the store was closed indefinitely. Good old American Passive-Aggressive Butt-Whoopin'!]  Pass this along. America needs to know that we're all working together.",

No plastic wrap in micro  Johns Hopkins has recently sent this out in their newsletters worth noting... This information is being circulated at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. Dioxin Carcinogens cause cancer, especially breast cancer. Don't freeze your plastic water bottles with water as this also releases dioxins in the plastic.  Dr. Edward Fujimoto from Castle hospital was on a TV program explaining this health hazard. (He is the manager of the Wellness Program at the hospital.)  He was talking about dioxins and how bad they are for us. He said that we should not be heating our food in the microwave using plastic containers. This applies to foods that contain fat. He said that the combination fat, high heat and plastics releases dioxins into the food and ultimately into the cells of the body. Dioxins are carcinogens and highly toxic to the cells of our bodies. Instead, he recommends using glass, Corning Ware, or ceramic containers for heating food. You get the same results, without the dioxins. So such things as TV dinners, instant ramen and soups, should be removed from the container and heated in something else. Paper isn't bad but you don't know what is in the paper. It's just safer to use tempered glass, Corning Ware, etc. He said we might remember when some of the fast food restaurants moved away from the foam containers to paper. The dioxin problem is one of the reasons. To add to this, Saran wrap placed over foods as they are nuked, with the high heat, actually drips poisonous toxins into the food, use paper towels. Pass this on to your family & friends & those that are important in your life!",

I believe it can also save and create jobs in America while giving people better customer service.  So, how many times have you called a companies service phone line and found that the rep. can barely speak English? Once with a major mortgage company it was so bad I demanded to speak with someone who spoke English. Right at that moment I broke the code, the secret password for customer service.  Come to find out that every American company using overseas operators must transfer you to an American rep. by saying I want to speak to a representative in America. (Don't take no for an answer on this)  This was confirmed by the American rep. that they must transfer you after that request. I've tried it on a half a dozen major companies including cable, bank, phone and mortgage companies. It works every time and I actually get my issues taken care of.  Another thing to help save even more jobs ... don't use the automated check out lanes they are pushing at the big box stores. Once again, I found out that if we use those check outs rather than cashiers, people lose their jobs too. I've refused to use the automated check outs and have had two cashiers already thank me for help saving their job. I didn't know we could do this, and will start doing it from now on to keep Americans working.   ",

Bien qu’il y aie eu plusieurs initiatives par le passé, des Américains de confession musulmane ont instauré depuis l’année 2013, le 1er février comme étant la journée mondiale du voile islamique (hijab). Une démarche de promotion qui, à grand renfort de publicité, se repend partout dans le monde et même à Montpellier. Ainsi le 1er février dernier, une quinzaine de femmes voilées se sont retrouvées au parc du Peyrou pour aller « à la rencontre des montpelliérains pour discuter et échanger sur le statut du voile en France ». Elles ont également proposé à plusieurs femmes d’essayer de porter le voile islamique. Les organisatrices espèrent que l’année prochaines elles pourront « participer encore à cette journée avec plus de moyens et avec plus de visibilité. » Ce « World Hijab Day » a été organisé à Montpellier par l’association Tabassam dont le but est de « promouvoir la réussite des jeunes issus des milieux modestes ou autre en leur apportant un accompagnement personnalisé tant sur le plan psychologique que scolaire. Favoriser les échanges, afin de diminuer toute forme d’intolérance et de discrimination par la création d’événements et de débats organisés. Venir en aide au plus démunis à travers différentes actions humanitaires. » Problème, sur les photos de l’association lors du rassemblement du 1er février, en plus des femmes portant le hijab, d’autres femmes portent, elles, le niqab, c’est à dire le voile intégral dont le port est pourtant rigoureusement interdit dans l’espace public. On peut donc être surpris lorsque l’on apprend sur le site « Les Musulmans de Montpellier », que cette association tire une partie de ses finances grâce à des subventions accordées par la mairie de Montpellier.",

Rue Charles Baltimore, MD 1201. Ceci est la dernière nouveauté en médecine, effective pour contrer le cancer !!!Lisez avec attention le message que l'on vient de m'envoyer, j'espère que vous le ferez suivre !!!Bienfaits du citron.Le citron (citrus) est un produit miraculeux pour tuer les cellules cancereuses.Il est 10.000 fois plus puissant que la chimiothérapie.Pourquoi ne sommes-nous pas au courant de cela?Parce qu'il existe des laboratoires intéressés par la fabrication d'une version synthétique qui leur rapportera d'énormes bénéfices.Vous pouvez désormais aider un ami qui en a besoin en lui faisant savoir que le jus de citron lui est bénéfique pour prévenir la maladie.Son goût est agréable et il ne produit pas les horribles effets de la chimiothérapie.Si vous en avez la possibilité, plantez un citronnier dans votre patio ou votre jardin.Combien de personnes meurent pendant que ce secret est jalousement gardé pour ne pas porter atteinte aux bénéfices multimilionnaires de grandes corporations ?Comme vous le savez, le citronnier est bas, n'occupe pas beaucoup d'espace et est connu pour ses variétés de citrons et de limes.Vous pouvez consommer le fruit de manières différentes: vous pouvez manger la pulpe, la presser en jus, élaborer des boissons, sorbets, patisseries, ...On lui attribue plusieurs vertus mais la plus intéressante est l'effet qu'elle produit sur les kystes et les tumeurs.Cette plante est un remède prouvé contre les cancers de tous types. Certains affirment qu'elle est de grande utilité dans toutes les variantes de cancer.On la considère aussi comme un agent anti microbien à large spectre contre les infections bactériennes et les champignons, efficace contre les parasites internes et les vers, elle régule la tension artérielle trop haute et est antidépressive, combat la tension et les désordres nerveux.La source de cette information est fascinante: elle provient d'un des plus grands fabricants de médicaments au monde, qui affirme qu'après plus de 20 essais effectués en laboratoire depuis 1970, les extraits ont révélé que:Il détruit les cellules malignes dans 12 types de cancer, y compris celui du côlon, du sein, de la prostate, du poumon et du pancréas...Les composés de cet arbre ont démontré agir 10.000 fois mieux que le produit Adriamycin, une drogue chimiothérapeutte normalement utilisée dans le monde, en ralentissant la croissance des cellules du cancer.Et ce qui est encore plus étonnant: ce type de thérapie avec l'extrait de citron détruit non seulement les cellules malignes du cancer et n'affecte pas les cellules saines. Institut de Sciences de la Santé, L.L.C. 819 N.

        "tweet": "The following was said to be written by a dentist in Australia.     You probably missed it in the rush of news last week, but there was actually a report that someone in Pakistan had published in a newspaper there an offer of a reward to anyone who killed an American, any American.  So I just thought I would write to let them know what an American is, so they would know when they found one.  An American is English ... or French, or Italian, Irish, German, Spanish, Polish, Russian or Greek. An American may also be African, Indian, Chinese, Japanese, Australian, Iranian, Asian, or Arab, or Pakistani, or Afghan.  An American is Christian, or he could be Jewish, or Buddhist, or Muslim. In fact, there are more Muslims in America than in Afghanistan. The only difference is that in America they are free to worship as each of them choose.  An American is also free to believe in no religion. For that he will answer only to God, not to the government, or to armed thugs claiming to speak for the government and for God.  An American is from the most prosperous land in the history of the world. The root of that prosperity can be found in the Declaration of Independence, which recognizes the God-given right of each man and woman to the pursuit of happiness.  An American is generous. Americans have helped out just about every other nation in the world in their time of need. When Afghanistan was overrun by the Soviet army 20 years ago, Americans came with arms and supplies to enable the people to win back their country. As of the morning of September 11, Americans had given more than any other nation to the poor in Afghanistan.  An American does not have to obey the mad ravings of ignorant, ungodly cruel, old men. American men will not be fooled into giving up their lives to kill innocent people, so that these foolish old men may hold on to power. American women are free to show their beautiful faces to the world, as each of them choose.  An American is free to criticize his government's officials when they are wrong, in his or her own opinion. Then he is free to replace them, by majority vote.  Americans welcome people from all lands, all cultures, all religions, because they are not afraid. They are not afraid that their history, their religion, their beliefs, will be overrun, or forgotten. That is because they know they are free to hold to their religion, their beliefs, their history, as each of them choose.  And just as Americans welcome all, they enjoy the best that everyone has to bring, from all over the world. The best science, the best technology, the best products, the best books, the best music, the best food, the best athletes.  Americans welcome the best, but they also welcome the least. The nation symbol of America welcomes your tired and your poor, the wretched refuse of your teeming shores, the homeless, tempest tossed.  These in fact are the people who built America. Many of them were working in the twin towers on the morning of September 11, earning a better life for their families.  So you can try to kill an American if you must. Hitler did. So did General Tojo and Stalin and Mao Tse-Tung, and every bloodthirsty tyrant in the history of the world.  But in doing so you would just be killing yourself. Because Americans are not a particular people from a particular place. They are the embodiment of the human spirit of freedom. Everyone who holds to that spirit, everywhere, is an American.  So look around you. You may find more Americans in your land than you thought were there. One day they will rise up and overthrow the old, ignorant, tired tyrants that trouble too many lands. Then those lands too will join the community of free and prosperous nations.  And America will welcome them.[Click here to expand text].",

The ACLU jumped on the opportunity to once again pick up the cause of the godless and assigned their sharpest attorneys to the case. The case was brought before a wise judge who after listening to the long, passionate presentation of the ACLU lawyers, promptly banged his gavel and declared, Case dismissed!  The lead ACLU lawyer immediately stood and objected to the ruling and said, Your honor, how can you possibly dismiss this case? Surely the Christians have Christmas, Easter and many other observances. And the Jews — why in addition to Passover they have Yom Kippur and Hanukkah . . . and yet my client and all other atheists have no such holiday!  The judge leaned forward in his chair and simply said Obviously your client is too confused to know about, or for that matter, even celebrate the atheists' holiday!  The ACLU lawyer pompously said: We are aware of no such holiday for atheists. Just when might that be, Your Honor?  The judge said, Well, it comes every year on exactly the same date — April 1st!The fool says in his heart, There is no God. — Psalm 14:1, Psalm 53:1HOORAY FOR THIS JUDGE",

So he is given permission to select a car from the lot there at the factory. He selects a Chevrolet Caprice, a big, luxury car. After receiving it, he is satisfied with his choice. After all, who wouldn't enjoy driving around in a roomy, comfortable car. After driving it for a while, he noticed something quite odd ... a car like this usually consumes a substantial amount of fuel, but the gas gauge hardly moves at all.  After a few weeks, he gets suspicious. Things like this don't happen. Being the company man he is, he returns it to the factory. Explaining this to the service tech must've caused some strange looks, but they took it in anyway. After he got his car back, he noticed it got the typical gas mileage of a comparable car. Could've this car had some secret modifications that allowed him to drive for weeks, on the same tank of gas? Detroit's automakers have purportedly seized, er.. bought out patents of items that improve gasoline mileage like the 100 mpg carburetor, etc. Maybe the R&D department at GM put this theory to practice, and this was an example.   ",

Has lost his job and faces possible legal proceedings as the company strives to reclaim the costs of the 18 Porsches given away free under Glen's Opening day buy one get one free promotion. I admit I didn't really do the numbers properly on this one said Glen who told reporters that he had seen the concept work really well for coffee stores and in terms of numbers you could argue that Glen's campaign worked. As the new Porsche dealer sold 18 Porches in the first hour of the store opening.  It took the head office a full hour to realise what was going on and subsequently shut the store.  Local man Bruce Stepper took out a second mortgage on his home after getting a promotional flyer in his mailbox. I am ecstatic - I brought a shiny red Porsche today, got another one free and I have sold just sold it on EBay, all up I end up getting a Porsche 911 for $5000.  Jane Cameron was arguably even more entrepreneurial. The local Janitor purchased a Porsche using the dealers no deposit finance plan for low income earners, sold both cars, paid off the finance account and walked away with $120,000 profit. The finance plan was another one of Glen's initiatives that has now been cancelled.  A red faced Glen stated I have never really been too good at Math and I was sure the whole time we were making money - I was initially blown away by the amount of cars we were selling in that first hour. I had seen the buy one get one free card work extremely well for the new coffee shop down the road and thought what a great idea I will try it here.  National spokesman for the dealership chain was quoted as saying We are just glad that the idiot didn’t have time to run with his 'test drive 5 cars, get one free loyalty stamp card' campaign.",

Et si le défilé du 14 juillet n'avait pas lieu ce jour-là, mais plutôt le 15 juillet? L'information parait farfelue mais prendrait tout son sens en cas de finale de Coupe du monde des Bleus le dimanche 13 juillet prochain. Selon nos informations, des discussions ont lieu actuellement en haut lieu pour parer à cette éventualité. La problématique est simple. Le président de la République, François Hollande, voudrait se déplacer au Brésil si la bande de Didier Deschamps se hissait jusqu'au dernier stade de la compétition. Sauf que la finale est prévue le dimanche soir à 22h heure française et que le traditionnel défilé du 14 juillet a lieu le lendemain matin. Autant dire, qu'il est impossible d'être présent aux deux évènements, trop proches en terme de créneaux horaires.

If you can prepare yours own chopsticks at your office, it's not only environmental friendly and it's for your own good.  In a campaign promoting healthy care in An Ning, professor Chew reminds people not to use disposable chopsticks, as almost majority of them are made in and imported from china. Before the production, the raw materials itself already grown with germs that are in multiply colors (fungus), and the first process was put in chemical to preserve the materials then after that they are washed with bleach (which believes are to be thousands times over the standards). And guess what? These chemicals could cause cancer, Carcinogen. Professor Chew didn't use any disposable chopsticks anymore since she last visited a disposable chopsticks manufacturing plant 5 years ago. In case she forgotten to bring her own chopsticks, she always put one in her bag, since it can be reuse again and again.

        "tweet": "April 1, 2009  Final Nail In Obamas Lack Of US Citizenship Coffin?  AP- WASHINGTON D.C. - In a move certain to fuel the debate over Obamas qualifications for the presidency, the group Americans for Freedom of Information has released copies of President Obamas college transcripts from Occidental College. Released today, the transcript indicates that Obama, under the name Barry Soetoro, received financial aid as a foreign student from Indonesia as an undergraduate at the school. The transcript was released by Occidental College in compliance with a court order in a suit brought by the group in the Superior Court of California. The transcript shows that Obama (Soetoro) applied for financial aid and was awarded a fellowship for foreign students from the Fulbright Foundation Scholarship program. To qualify, for the scholarship, a student must claim foreign citizenship. This document would seem to provide the smoking gun that many of Obamas detractors have been seeking.  The news has created a firestorm at the White House as the release casts increasing doubt about Obamas legitimacy and qualification to serve as president. When reached for comment in London, where he has been in meetings with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Obama smiled but refused comment on the issue. Meanwhile, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs scoffed at the report stating that this was obviously another attempt by a right-wing conservative group to discredit the president and undermine the administrations efforts to move the country in a new direction.  Britain's Daily Mail has also carried the story in a front-page article titled, Obama Eligibility Questioned, leading some to speculate that the story may overshadow economic issues on Obamas first official visit to the U.K.  In a related matter, under growing pressure from several groups, Justice Antonin Scalia announced that the Supreme Court agreed on Tuesday to hear arguments  concerning Obamas legal eligibility to serve as President in a case brought by Leo Donofrio of New Jersey. This lawsuit claims Obama's dual citizenship disqualified him from serving as president. Donofrios case is just one of 18 suits brought by citizens demanding proof of Obamas citizenship or qualification to serve as president.  Gary Kreep of the United States Justice Foundation has released the results of their investigation of Obamas campaign spending. This study estimates that Obama has spent upwards of $950,000 in campaign funds in the past year with eleven law firms in 12 states for legal resources to block disclosure of any of his personal records. Mr. Kreep indicated that the investigation is still ongoing but that the final report will be provided to the U.S. attorney general, Eric Holder. Mr. Holder has refused to comment on the matter.",

This lady went for her Chemo treatments yesterday and the doctor had asked her if there was anything she had been taking such as vitamins etc.. She mentioned to the doctor that she was fighting a cold and she was taking Cold FX. Turns out the doctor said to her that for a WOMAN, Cold FX is the worst thing to take if you've had cancer or if cancer runs in your family. Apparently there is a substance in the Cold FX that the cancer just feed off of.  The doctor repeatedly told her how dangerous it was and to absolutely avoid it. The doctor said to her that they really wish the word could get out there about how dangerous it can be for a woman to take Cold FX who has had or currently has cancer or has a family history of cancer.",

Because you don't particularly like them! Besides, I already know what the captain of the football team is doing these days: mowing my lawn.  New Rule: Don't eat anything that's served to you out a window unless you're a seagull. People are acting all shocked that a human finger was found in a bowl of Wendy's chili. Hey, it cost less than a dollar. What did you expect it to contain? Trout?  New Rule: Stop saying that teenage boys who have sex with their hot, blonde teachers are permanently damaged. I have a better description for these kids: lucky bastards.  New Rule: If you need to shave and you still collect baseball cards, you're gay. If you're a kid, the cards are keepsakes of your idols. If you're a grown man, they're pictures of men.  New Rule: Ladies, leave your eyebrows alone. Here's how much men care about your eyebrows: do you have two of them? Okay, we're done.  New Rule: There's no such thing as flavored water. There's a whole aisle of this crap at the supermarket — water, but without that watery taste. Sorry, but flavored water is called a soft drink. You want flavored water? Pour some scotch over ice and let it melt. That's your flavored water.  New Rule: Stop f***ing with old people. Target is introducing a redesigned pill bottle that's square, with a bigger label. And the top is now the bottom. And by the time grandpa figures out how to open it, his ass will be in the morgue. Congratulations, Target, you just solved the Social Security crisis.  New Rule: The more complicated the Starbucks order, the bigger the asshole. If you walk into a Starbucks and order a decaf grande half-soy, half-low fat, iced vanilla, double-shot, gingerbread cappuccino, extra dry, light ice, with one Sweet-n'-Low and one NutraSweet, ooh, you're a huge asshole.  New Rule: I'm not the cashier! By the time I look up from sliding my card, entering my PIN number, pressing Enter, verifying the amount, deciding, no, I don't want cash back, and pressing Enter again, the kid who is supposed to be ringing me up is standing there eating my Almond Joy.  New Rule: Just because your tattoo has Chinese characters in it doesn't make you spiritual. It's right above the crack of your ass. And it translates to beef with broccoli. The last time you did anything spiritual, you were praying to God you weren't pregnant. You're not spiritual. You're just high.  New Rule: Competitive eating isn't a sport. It's one of the seven deadly sins. ESPN recently televised the US Open of Competitive Eating, because watching those athletes at the poker table was just too damned exciting. What's next, competitive farting? Oh wait. They're already doing that. It's called The Howard Stern Show.  New Rule: I don't need a bigger mega M&M. If I'm extra hungry for M&Ms, I'll go nuts and eat two.  New Rule: If you're going to insist on making movies based on crappy, old television shows, then you have to give everyone in the Cineplex a remote so we can see what's playing on the other screens. Let's remember the reason something was a television show in the first place is that the idea wasn't good enough to be a movie.  New Rule: No more gift registries. You know, it used to be just for weddings. Now it's for babies and new homes and graduations from rehab. Picking out the stuff you want and having other people buy it for you isn't gift giving, it's the white people version of looting.  New Rule: and this one is long overdue: No more bathroom attendants. After I zip up, some guy is offering me a towel and a mint like I just had sex with George Michael. I can't even tell if he's supposed to be there, or just some freak with a fetish. don't want to be on your webcam, dude. I just want to wash my hands.  New Rule: When I ask how old your toddler is, I don't need to know in months. 27 Months. He's two, will do just fine. He's not a cheese. And I didn't really care in the first place.",

Please feel free to forward on...in fact PLEASE warn everyone you know!!  Justin and I were driving down Wilshire (coming off Broadway Extension). I was headed toward Western (if you are familiar with the area it was right before the 7-11) driving back to work. We had two black young males jump out into the road and throw a brick through the passenger side of the windshield. Justin is ok, and I am ok. Luckily, I kept driving. I called 9-1-1. When the police came they said that this is a gang thing. They throw the rock or brick or whatever, hoping you will pull over to yell or something. They then either rob you or they shoot you. THEY FREAKING KILL YOU!! I am shaken up, I am angry. They could have hurt my baby boy. Or as you all know me and my mouth, what if I would have pulled over??? Luckily, I kept my mouth in check this time. Please, if this happens to you, do NOT pull over. They are looking for you. ALSO, the police officer said that my car SCREAMS I am a young, possibly single woman, with no man riding with me. He said most men wont ride in my car, bright yellow cobalt (which is true). They look for this type of thing, so my car was a target. I WILL not drive that way anymore, obviously but I wanted to warn you all. This is not a forward or anything, this happened to me, MISTY, your friend, sister, mother, etc..... Please do not pull over... no matter how mad you are. Call 9-1-1. And report it. Keep your car doors locked, and your windows rolled up even while driving. If possible, put your kiddos in the back seats.  Your melodramatic but honest friend, Misty",

I believe the money I make belongs to me and my family, not some mid-level governmental functionary with a bad comb-over who wants to give it away to crack addicts squirting out babies. I don't care about appearing compassionate. I think playing with guns doesn't make you a killer. I believe its called the Boy Scouts for a reason. I think I'm better than the homeless. I am not the real Slim Shady, so I think that I’m gonna stay seated right here in this damn comfy chair. I don't think being a minority makes you noble or victimized. I don't care if you call me a racist, a homophobe or a misogynist. I am not tolerant of others because they are different. I know that no matter how big Jennifer Lopez’s toilet gets, I’ll still want to see it.  I don't celebrate Kwanzaa.  I believe that if you are selling me a Big Mac, you do it in English. I like my porn without silicon. I don't use the excuse it's for the children as a shield for unpopular opinions or actions. I want to know when MTV became such crap. I think getting a hummer is sex, and every man is entitled to at least one extremely sloppy one per month. I know what the definition of is is. I think Oprah's eyes are way too far apart. I didn't take the initiative in inventing the Internet. I thought the Taco Bell dog was funny. I want them to bring back safe and sane fireworks.  I believe no one ever died because of something Ozzy Osbourne, Ice-T or Marilyn Manson sang. I think that being a student doesn’t give you any more enlightenment than working at Blockbuster. I’ve never mourned a dead goldfish. I don’t want to eat or drink anything with the words light, lite or fat-free on the package. I believe everyone has a right to pray to their God or gods, while I pray that the test results come back negative. I think the Clippers should play in the WNBA. My heroes are Abraham Lincoln, Orson Wells, Ronald Reagan and whoever canceled Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman. I think creative violence makes movies more interesting and Iraqis more dead.  I don't hate the rich. I don't pity the poor.  I know wrestling is fake, but I still think The Rock could kick my butt. I think global warming is junk science. I’ve never owned or was a slave, I didn't wander forty years in the desert after getting chased out of Egypt, I haven’t burned any witches or been persecuted by the Turks and neither have you, so shut-the-f-up already. South Park still makes me laugh. I think you can respect and admire women while mentally undressing them. I believe a self-righteous liberal with a cause is more dangerous than a PlayStation. I want to know which church is it exactly where the Rev. Jessie Jackson preaches. I think explosions are cool. I don't care where Ellen puts her tongue. I think the cops have every right to shoot your sorry ass if you’re running from them. I thought Spinal Tap was great, but Rob Reiner can still kiss my backside.  I worry about dying before I get even.  I’ve discovered that DVD is better than Laserdisc. I like the convenience of buying oranges while I'm waiting at a stop-light, and I'm pretty sure the Latina midget selling them to me is glad she no longer lives in a refrigerator packing carton outside Ensenada. I figured out Bruce Willis was dead midway through The Sixth Sense but enjoyed it anyway. I think turkey bacon sucks. I want somebody to explain to me exactly why it's wrong to point out that when I watch a freeway chase, I know the losers the police eventually pull out of the car are gonna be a gang-banging hommies or vatos. I believe that it doesn't take a village to raise a child, it takes a parent. I think tattoos and piercings are fine if you want them, but please don’t pretend they are a political statement.  I want to know what the hell is going on when Geena Davis has a sitcom.  I like hard women, hard liquor and a hard bowel movement first thing in the morning. I believe you don’t have to speak with a lisp to pick out a couch for your living room. I'll admit that the only movie that ever made me cry was Field of Dreams. I didn't realize Dr. Seuss was a genius until I had a kid. I will not conform or compromise just to keep from hurting somebody's feelings. Sometimes I throw my soft drink can in the trash, even when the recycle bin is just a few more steps. Making love is fine, but sometimes I wanna get laid. I'm neither angry nor disenfranchised, no matter how desperately the mainstream media would like the world to believe otherwise.  Yes, I'm a bad Republican. And I vote... even if it rains.  Yes, I Guess I am A BAD American.  I like big cars, big boats, big houses, and naturally — big tits.  I believe the money I make belongs to me and my family, not some mid-level governmental functionary with a bad comb-over who wants to give it away to crack addicts squirting out babies. I don't care about appearing compassionate.  I think playing with toy guns doesn't make you a killer.  I believe it's called the Boy Scouts for a reason.  I think I'm doing better than the homeless.  I don't think being a minority makes you noble or victimized.  I have the right not to be tolerant of others because they are different, weird or piss me off.  I know what SEX is and there are not varying degrees of it. Hell, just ask my wife.  I don't celebrate Kwanzaa. But if you want to that's fine just don't feel like everyone else should have to.  I believe that if you are selling me a Dairy queen shake, pack of cigarettes, or hotel room you do it in English.  As of matter of fact, if you are an American citizen you should speak English. My father and grandfather shouldn't have to die in vain so you can leave the countries you were born in to come disrespect ours.  I think the cops have every right to shoot your sorry ass if you're running from them after they tell you to stop. If you can't understand the word freeze or stop in English, See the previous line.  If I received a blow job from one of my subordinate employees in my office, it wouldn't be a private matter or my personal business. I would have been FIRED immediately.  I know how to count votes and I feel much safer letting a machine with no political affiliation recount when needed.  I know what the definition of lying is.  I don't think just because you were not born in this country, you qualify for any special loan programs, gov't sponsored bank loans, etc., so you can you can open a hotel, c-store, trinket shop, or any damn thing else.  I thought the Taco Bell dog was funny.  I want them to bring back safe and sane fireworks.  I believe no one ever died because of something Ozzy Osbourne, Ice-T or Marilyn Manson sang, but that doesn't mean I want to listen to that crap from someone else's car when I'm stopped at a red light.But I respect your right to.  I think that being a student doesn't give you any more enlightenment than working at Blockbuster or Jack In The Box.  I don't want to eat or drink anything with the words light, Lite, or fat-free on the package.  I did not go to some foreign country and risk my life in vain and defend our constitution so that decades later you can tell me it's a living document ever changing and is open to interpretation.  I don't hate the rich.  I don't pity the poor.  I know wrestling is fake.  I've never owned or was a slave, and a large percentage or our forefathers weren't wealthy enough to own one either.  I think you can respect and admire women while mentally undressing them.  I believe a self-righteous liberal with a cause is more dangerous than a Hell's Angel with an attitude.  I want to know which church is it exactly where the Rev. Jesse Jackson preaches and besides what exactly is his job function.  I don't care where Ellen puts her tongue.  I own a gun, you can own a gun, and any red blooded American should be allowed to own a gun, but if you use it in a crime then you will serve the time. A rubber band and a paper clip is a dangerous weapon in the hands of someone with malicious intent.  I worry about dying before I get even.  I didn't take the initiative in inventing the Internet.  I think Bill Gates has every right to keep every penny he made and continue to make more. If it pisses you off, invent the next operating system that's better and put your name on the building. Ask your buddy that invented the Internet to help you.  I don't believe in hate crime legislation. Even suggesting it pisses me off. You're telling me that someone who is a minority, gay, disabled, another nationality, or otherwise different from the mainstream of this country has more value as a human being that I do as a white male. Hell, if someone kills anyone, I'd say that it's a hate crime.  I like the convenience of buying oranges from a sidewalk vendor or while I'm waiting at a stop-light, and I'm pretty sure the Latin midget selling them to me is glad she no longer lives in a refrigerator box in East LA or is sleeping in the streets of her home country.  We don't need more laws! Let's enforce the ones we already have.  I think turkey bacon, turkey beef, turkey fake anything sucks.  I believe that it doesn't take a village to raise a child, it takes a parent with the balls to stand up to the kid and spank his butt and say NO.  I think tattoos and piercing are fine if you want them, but please don't pretend they are a political statement.  I'll admit that the only movie that ever made me cry was Ole Yeller.  I didn't realize Dr. Seuss was a genius until I had a kid.  I will not be frowned upon or be looked down upon or be made to keep silent because I have these beliefs and opinions.  I thought this country allowed me that right I will not conform or compromise just to keep from hurting somebody's feelings.  I'm neither angry nor disenfranchised, no matter how desperately the mainstream media would like the world to believe otherwise.  Yes, I guess by their definition, I'm a bad American.",

They have beaten women to near death, and then continue to rape them with baseball bats and other torture methods. This is not just a forward of information, it is within our area.

I started to explain the length of the flight and the passport information then she interrupted me with, I'm not trying to make you look stupid, but Capetown is in Massachusetts. Without trying to make her look like the stupid one, I calmly explained, Cape Cod is in Massachusetts, Capetown is in Africa. Her response ... click.A Senior Vermont Congressman called, furious about a Florida package we did. I asked what was wrong with the vacation in Orlando. He said he was expecting an ocean-view room. I tried to explain that is not possible, since Orlando is in the middle of the state. He replied, Don't lie to me. I looked on the map, and Florida is a very thin state!!!I got a call from a Lawmakers Wife who asked, Is it possible to see England from Canada? I said, No. She said, But they look so close on the map. An Aide for a Bush cabinet member once called and asked if they could rent a car in Dallas. When I pulled up the reservation, I noticed they had only a 1-hour layover in Dallas. When I asked him why he wanted to rent a car, he said, I heard Dallas was a big airport, and we will need a car to drive between the gates to save time. An Illinois Congresswoman called last week. She needed to know how it was possible that her flight from Detroit left at 8:20am and got into Chicago at 8:33am. I tried to explain that Michigan was an hour ahead of Illinois, but she could not understand the concept of time zones. Finally, I told her the plane went very fast, and she bought that! A New York lawmaker called and asked, Do airlines put your physical description on your bag so they know who's luggage belongs to who? I said, No, why do you ask? She replied, Well, when I checked in with the airline, they put a tag on my luggage that said (FAT), and I'm overweight I think that is very rude. After putting her on hold for a minute while I looked into it (I was actually laughing) I came back and explained the city code for Fresno, CA is (FAT), and that the airline was just putting a destination tag on her luggage. A Senator's Aide called in inquiring about a trip package to Hawaii. After going over all the cost info, she asked, Would it be cheaper to fly to California and then take the train to Hawaii? I just got off the phone with a freshman Congressman who asked, How do I know which plane to get on? I asked him what exactly he meant, to which he replied, I was told my flight number is 823, but none of these darn planes have numbers on them.",

Seeing several First Class seats open, he began to argue with the flight attendant over why he had not been upgraded.  The flight attendant said she would get a gate agent to look into the matter, but the Elite member began swearing at her profusely.  Gordon was on his way back from the cockpit when this occurred, and intervened, asking, Can I help somehow?  The passenger said, Huh? Who the f*** are you?  I'm the CEO of this company, Gordon replied. May I see your ticket, sir?  The passenger gave his ticket to Gordon, who saw a total fare of just under six hundred dollars. He then pulled out his billfold and peeled off six $100 bills, placing them in the man's hand.  And then he tore the ticket up.  Now, Gordon said, you get the f*** off my airplane!

        "tweet": "An outbreak of swine flu occurred in Mexico this spring that eventually affected 4,910 Mexican citizens and resulted in 85 deaths. By the time it spread to the United States, the virus caused only mild cases of flu-like illness.  Thanks to air travel and the failure of public health officials to control travel from Mexico, the virus spread worldwide. Despite predictions of massive numbers of deaths and the arrival of doomsday, the virus has remained a relatively mild disease, something we know happens each year with flu epidemics.  Worldwide, there have only been 311 deaths out of 70,893 cases of swine flu. In the United States, 27,717 cases have resulted in 127 deaths. Every death is a tragedy, but such a low death rate should not be the basis of a draconian government policy.  It is helpful to recall that the Centers for Disease Control with the collusion of the media, constantly tell us that 36,000 people die from the flu each year, a figure that has been shown to be a lie. In this case, we are talking about 300 plus deaths for the entire world.  This virus continues to be an enigma for virologists. In the April 30, 2009 issue of Nature, a virologist was quoted as saying, Where the hell it got all these genes from we don’t know. Extensive analysis of the virus found that it contained the original 1918 H1N1 flu virus, the avian flu virus (bird flu), and two new H3N2 virus genes from Eurasia. Debate continues over the possibility that swine flu is a genetically engineered virus.  Naturally, vaccine manufacturers have been in a competitive battle to produce the first vaccine. The main contenders have been Baxter Pharmaceuticals and Novartis Pharmaceuticals, the latter of which recently acquired the scandal-ridden Chiron vaccine company. Both of these companies have had agreements with the World Health Organization to produce a pandemic vaccine.  The Baxter vaccine, called Celvapan, has had fast track approval. It uses a new vero cell technology, which utilizes cultured cells from the African green monkey. This same animal tissue transmits a number of vaccine-contaminating viruses, including the HIV virus.  The Baxter company has been associated with two deadly scandals. The first event occurred in 2006 when hemophiliac components were contaminated with HIV virus and injected in tens of thousands of people, including thousands of children. Baxter continued to release the HIV contaminated vaccine even after the contamination was known.  The second event occurred recently when it was discovered that Baxter had released a seasonal flu vaccine containing the bird flu virus, which would have produced a real world  pandemic, to 18 countries. Fortunately, astute lab workers in the Czech Republic discovered the deadly combination and blew the whistle before a worldwide disaster was unleashed.  Despite these two deadly events, WHO maintains an agreement with Baxter Pharmaceuticals to produce the world’s pandemic vaccine. Novartis, the second contender, also has an agreement with WHO for a pandemic vaccine. Novartis appears to have won the contract, since their vaccine is near completion. What is terrifying is that these pandemic vaccines contain ingredients, called immune adjuvants that a number of studies have shown cause devastating autoimmune disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and lupus.  Animal studies using this adjuvant have found them to be deadly. A study using 14 guinea pigs found that when they were injected with the special adjuvant, only one animal survived. A repeat of the study found the same deadly outcome.  So, what is this deadly ingredient? It is called squalene, a type of oil. The Chiron company, maker of the deadly anthrax vaccine, makes an adjuvant called MF-59 which contains two main ingredients of concern — squalene and gp120. A number of studies have shown that squalene can trigger all of the above-mentioned autoimmune diseases when injected.  The MF-59 adjuvant has been used in several vaccines. These vaccines, including tetanus and diphtheria, are the same vaccines frequently associated with adverse reactions.  I reviewed a number of studies on this adjuvant and found something quite interesting. Several studies done on human test subjects found MF-59 to be a very safe immune adjuvant. But when I checked to see who did these studies, I found — to no surprise — that they were done by the Novartis Pharmaceutical Company and Chiron Pharmaceutical Company, which have merged. They were all published in “prestigious” medical journals. Also, to no surprise, a great number of studies done by independent laboratories and research institutions all found a strong link between MF-59 and autoimmune diseases.  Squalene in vaccines has been strongly linked to the Gulf War Syndrome. On August 1991, Anthony Principi, Secretary of Veterans Affairs admitted that soldiers vaccinated with the anthrax vaccine from 1990 to 1991 had an increased risk of 200 percent in developing the deadly disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also called Lou Gehrig’s disease. The soldiers also suffered from a number of debilitating and life-shortening diseases, such as polyarteritis nodosa, multiple sclerosis (MS), lupus, transverse myelitis (a neurological disorder caused by inflammation of the spinal cord), endocarditis (inflammation of the heart’s inner lining), optic neuritis with blindness and glomerulonephritis (a type of kidney disease).  Because squalene, the main ingredient in MF-59, can induce hyperimmune responses and induce autoimmunity, a real danger exists for prolonged activation of the brain’s immune cells, the microglia. This type of prolonged activation has been strongly associated with such diseases as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson's disease, ALS and possibly vaccine-related encephalitis. It has been shown that activation of the systemic immune system, as occurs with vaccination, rapidly activates the brain’s microglia at the same time, and this brain inflammation can persist for long periods.  So, how would the gp120 get into the brain? Studies of other immune adjuvants using careful tracer techniques have shown that they routinely enter the brain following vaccination. What most people do not know, even the doctors who recommend the vaccines, is that most such studies by pharmaceutical companies observe the patients for only one to two weeks following vaccination — these types of reactions may take months or even years to manifest.  It is obvious that the vaccine manufacturers stand to make billions of dollars in profits from this WHO/government-promoted pandemic. Novartis, the maker of the new pandemic vaccine, recently announced that they would not give free vaccines to impoverished nations — everybody pays.  One must keep in mind that once the vaccine is injected, there is little you can do to protect yourself — at least by conventional medicine. It will mean a lifetime of crippling illness and early death.  There are much safer ways to protect oneself from this flu virus, such as higher doses of vitamin D3, selective immune enhancement using supplements, and a good diet.",

National Guard helicopters are being denied landing and purchase of fuel at the Chevron Venice base. Petroleum Helicopters, Inc. (PHI), Air Logistics, Bristow and one other helicopter base just north of Venice are allowing full use of their bases and fuel supplies to our La. Nat. Guard Units. If it were not for the permission of these bases to allow fueling and landing privileges, our Guard Copters would need to return to Hammond, La. for fuel and necessary provisions to continue the fight against this oil spill.  When Chevron was queried about the denial to use their base, the answer was that it would cause a conflict of interest. Now just what the hell does that mean? I in fact know that some of Chevron's copter pilots were formally in the La. National Guard. And that when they were ordered to participate in the Iraq war they complained of poor health, bad backs, etc. They were discharged from the La. Guard, but of course bad health, bad backs, etc. they continued to fly for Chevron. Seems they were more interested in an easy pay check for weekend military duty with the La. Guard then service to their country.  From now on I will gladly refuel my vehicles at any other gas station that does not display the Chevron symbol since I now have a conflict of interest with you.",

        "tweet": "THIS FROM THE  LONDON DAILY TELEGRAPH EDITOR  This is a very sobering article. Our handling of relationships with the Britons over the oil spill won't help either.  From The London Daily Telegraph Editor On Foreign Relations  Quote:  Let me be clear: I'm not normally in favor of boycotts, and I love the American people. I holiday in their country regularly, and hate the tedious snobby sneers against the United States . But the American people chose to elect an idiot who seems hell bent on insulting their allies, and something must be done to stop Obama's reckless foreign policy, before he does the dirty on his allies on every issue.  One of the most poorly kept secrets in Washington is President Obama's animosity toward Great Britain, presumably because of what he regards as its sins while ruling Kenya (1895-1963). One of Barack Hussein Obama's first acts as president was to return to Britain a bust of Winston Churchill that had graced the Oval Office since 9/11. He followed this up by denying Prime Minister Gordon Brown, on his first state visit, the usual joint press conference with flags.  The president was too tired to grant the leader of America's closest ally a proper welcome, his aides told British journalists.  Mr. Obama followed this up with cheesy gifts for Mr. Brown and the Queen. Columnist Ian Martin described his behavior as rudeness  personified. There was more rudeness in store for Mr. Brown at the opening session of the United Nations in September. The prime minister was forced to dash through the kitchens of the UN in New York to secure five minutes of face time with President Obama after five requests for a sit down meeting were rejected by the White House, said London Telegraph columnist David Hughes. Mr. Obama's churlishness is unforgivable, Mr. Hughes said.  The administration went beyond snubs and slights last week when Secretary of State Hillary Clinton endorsed the demand of Argentine President Cristina Kirchner, a Hugo Chavez ally, for mediation of Argentina 's specious claim to the Falkland Islands, a British dependency since 1833. The people who live in the Falklands, who speak English, want nothing to do with Argentina . When, in 1982, an earlier Argentine dictatorship tried to seize the Falklands by force, the British — with strong support from President Ronald Reagan — expelled them.  It is truly shocking that Barack Obama has decided to disregard our shared history, wrote Telegraph columnist Toby Young. Does Britain 's friendship really mean so little to him?  One could ask, does the friendship of anyone in the entire world mean anything to him?  I recently asked several senior administration officials, separately, to name a foreign leader with whom Barack Obama has forged a strong personal relationship during his first year in office, wrote Jackson Diehl, deputy editorial page editor of the Washington Post, on Monday.  A lot of hemming and hawing ensued.  One official named French President Nicolas Sarkozy, but his contempt for Mr. Obama is an open secret. Another named German Chancellor Angela Merkel. But, said Mr. Diehl, Merkel too has been conspicuously cool toward Obama.  Mr. Obama certainly doesn't care about the Poles and Czechs, whom he has betrayed on missile defense. Honduras and Israel also can attest that he's been an unreliable ally and an unfaithful friend. Ironically, our relations with both Israel and the Palestinian Authority have never been worse. Russia has offered nothing in exchange for Mr. Obama's abandonment of missile defense. Russia and China won't support serious sanctions on Iran. Syria's support for terrorism has not diminished despite efforts to normalize diplomatic relations. The reclusive military dictatorship that runs Burma has responded to our efforts at engagement by deepening its ties to North Korea .  And the Chinese make little effort to disguise their contempt for him.  For the first time in a long time, the President of the United States is actually distrusted by its allies and not in the least feared by its adversaries. Nor is Mr. Obama now respected by the majority of Americans. Understandably focused on the dismal economy and Mr. Obama's relentless efforts to nationalize and socialize health care, Americans apparently have yet to notice his dismal performance and lack of respect in the world community.  They soon will.  —London Daily Telegraph editor — Alex Singleton",

White was pronounced dead on arrival after admission to an LA hospital early Monday morning. The death is being investigated as a suicide. Born Jaleel Ahmad White, he began his career at the age of three acting in television commercials, before landing guest spots on shows such as The Jeffersons and Mr. Belvedere. It was in 1989 that White landed the role that would make him famous, playing wacky neighbor 'Steve Urkel' on the ABC program Family Matters. Following the cancellation of Family Matters in 1997, friends claim White became obsessed with the character, and grew despondent, despite further successes as star and producer of the UPN sitcom Grownups, and as a writer for NBA.com. Neighbor and friend, Bradley Spencer alerted police after hearing what he described as a loud bang coming from White's Los Angeles apartment. Authorities state that upon entering the home they discovered a young African-American male with an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. Also found was a note, which read simply Did I do that?, a popular catchphrase from the show. Jaleel was an uncommonly good man, an exceptional role model and a great comedic actor, said William Bickley, who created the series, and Thomas L. Miller, one of the executive producers, in a joint statement. We feel privileged to have known him and worked with him. He'll be missed and remembered every day by his many, many friends, they said. Actress Kellie Williams — Laura Winslow on the series — described White as a consummate professional actor. Everyone adored him, she said. We have all lost a dear, dear brother, said Reginald VelJohnson, who played Carl Winslow. White, an only child, is survived by cousins, aunts, uncles, and wonderful friends, Bickley said. ",

She called me tonight (Monday) at 2230 hrs. and told me that there had been several MS-13 gang members hanging out in the PVA and in the store. She started having customers come in after pumping their gas and telling her that they over heard some of the Hispanics saying that they were going to be doing some initiations the next several nights by bumping cars. When the victim stopped and got out of the car, the member would then shoot the person who got out of the car.  She heard this from several customers that came in the store and her assistant had received a phone call from her mother stating the same. She said that they had called a radio station and they had heard the same thing.     My boyfriend received 4 text messages from his friends that stated the M-13 gang is doing initiations in Baltimore, MD and they are bumping people's cars and when the person gets out, they are ordered to shoot the other driver and make sure people notice. Not sure how true this is, but it is kind of scary!!     butterfli0729 (10:14:12 AM): i was at the game last night and during one of the intermissions, my friends boyfriend (a wilmington cop) got a call about gang initiation being in wilmington last night...where this hispanic gang rear ends cars and when the person gets out they shoot them  butterfli0729 (10:14:18 AM): and i was calling everyone...i called your sister too  butterfli0729 (10:14:25 AM): and now its rumored to happen here tonight  butterfli0729 (10:14:34 AM): it happened in charlotte a month ago and 14 people died     We received a call from a Monmouth County Sheriff's Officer. There is an initiation tonight for a local gang. They have advised us to be aware when driving. The gang will bump your car from behind and once you stop and get out, they will shoot you. If you are bumped from behind tonight, keep driving. If they surround you from the front and back, keep driving and continually blow your horn.  Please be careful and let your family know of this as well.     LET ALL KNOW THAT THERE IS A MEXICAN GANG INITIATION GOING ON NOW, IF SOME ONE BUMP YOUR CAR DO NOT GET OUT, THEY WILL SHOOT YOU.  THIS IS WHAT I GOT IN A TEXT MESSAGE IN MEMPHIS...IS THIS TRUE!!!     Hey Everyone,  I just thought I would pass this along. You can take the information and do what you want with it. My husband, Derek, just called me to warn me of a Gang, MS13, that has begun initiations. What they are doing is coming up behind you at a stop light or stop sign and bumping into the back of your car. When you get out to look at the damage, they are 'plowing' you over. His boss, who was head of Narcotics in Pender county, is the one that informed him of this and told him to please pass it on. His warning to me is very reliable since he does have an inside to the police department.     A Correctional Officer at one of the Northern California area's institutions intelligence division just intercepted a message from the national known South American gang MS13. The gang is expanding into the Northern California region rapidly. The message to the members outside was to hold gang initiations tonight (Thursday 3/27/08). They plan to slightly bump cars from the rear or from the side. When the occupants get out of their cars to look at the damage and confront the offending car they plan to shoot the individual. I certainly don't mean to cause you to panic or anything, but my nephew was told by his division officer to inform any and all his friends and family since they consider the threat very credible and likely to occur. I suggest that you email or call your friends and family in the area and inform them. Better to be a bit cautious, then to be sorry later.     Good morning everyone, please note this is not a forward, this is something I am sending out as a warning due to a phone call Shane and I received last night from a friend who is a Harris County Sheriff Deputy. We were informed that right now the MS13 gang is doing a lot of initiations this week and the next couple of weeks. What the Deputy and others have found out from arresting some of these low lives is that they are going around rear ending vehicles and then when you pull over and get out of your vehicle to check the damage they are shooting you.  This is especially taking place in Harris County but is also going on in the surrounding areas. So everyone please keep this in the back of your mind if you end up in a situation especially at night where you have been rear ended.     I'm giving you this little tid bit of info due to the gang involved is spreading to multiple counties and it can happen anywhere.  There is a new gang initiation going on this week into next week, what these jerks are doing is driving behind or beside people and then proceeding to hit your car, when you stop and get out to see what happened they shoot you in point blank range. These are the same people that killed those Delaware college kids, and they have so far, killed 6 people that way this week alone. So please if someone hits you and you look in the car and they look suspicious just keep going don't stop.  Union and essex county are the worst spots, but from the meeting the county police gang task force had they are going out of the county to have a better chance of not getting caught.     The Tucson Police Department contacted Security with the following information:  A new gang calling themselves the MS13 is now active in the Tucson area and are recruiting new members. Gang intelligence has discovered information that this gang will be starting an initiation process for future members. This initiation includes causing a minor accident to any of our citizens and when the unsuspecting person exits their vehicle, these gang members will shoot them.  This gang has an extremely violent past and has been in California for some time.  If you are in an accident and feel at all uncomfortable with the occupants of the other vehicle, remain in your vehicle and call 911 if possible.",

I have known this woman and her husband for almost 30 years this is a true story.  She and her husband were sitting down front and after the previews, just before the movie started she realized that someone slipped in two seats over from them with an empty seat in between them. She glanced over to look at the person who had just slipped in beside her. I won't give you the description until later...as she glanced over for a second time, this Person pulled up a brief case, placed it in their lap, and was holding onto it for dear life. This person never glanced over at my friend but kept their Eyes straight ahead, until they received the buzz of text message over Their cell phone. This person glanced a at the text message but didn't respond to the message. This person then continued to receive text messages every few minutes. How many people do you know that bring their brief cases to the movie, much less placing them in their laps during the movie and Clutching them? And how many times do you see people get text messages in a movie that don't respond to them? At least to say..I'm at a movie, leave me alone.  Oh by the way...this person that had the brief case was dressed as a Muslim woman. Black cloth covered them from head to toe with only the eyes visible. She could not be sure that this was a woman because only the eyes were showing.  After about 1 hour of squirming in their seats my friend and her husband left the movie and tried to find a manager. Well, most of the people working there were about 15-16 years old and a 90 year old ticket taker and there was not a manager there at that time. None of them saw the urgency in the situation. She told them about the brief case, text messaging, and how this person was dressed. One of the workers said...Oh I saw THEM...there was a whole group of them. They all went to different movies. DUH! Are any of you thinking what I am thinking? They also asked about security....security doesn't come in until 7pm - 9pm.  Do you think maybe this was a test? The 911 bombers tested their plan 14 times before it was actually acted upon. Or was it going to be the real thing that for some reason was stopped? We may never know but I have been sufficiently thrown into high alert. Do what you want with this information, but I for one will not be racing to the movie theater anytime soon.  Think about this...no screening, no security, visibility greatly reduced (dark) and apparently most people are totally oblivious as to suspicious activity at movie theaters!  Sorry to be the bearer of disturbing news, but I want to make the people I care about be more aware of their surroundings, perhaps we all need to Have a phone number for a Homeland Security contact in our cell phones!",

I've always told her she's my hero and I wish I had a tiny bit of her nerve. Read what she did last night (below)...and I can honestly see her doing this. She doesn't take cr@p off anyone. Feel free to pass this on...maybe this guy's business will go under!  As some of you may know the Marathon gas station in front of what use to be Underdogs and across from the Pawn shop (in Pontiac) is owned by a Pakistani. I've heard some rumors the last 6 months or so that a couple of our soldiers have stopped in, dressed in fatigues, after drill and he would not allow them to purchase anything in the store. They were asked to leave and told their business is not wanted or needed. Apparently this happened again on Sunday. You don't know how much of what you hear is actually true so I stopped in last night on the way to the B & G club. I don't really know why, I'm not sure what I thought I was going to say or do but I had to check this guy out. Luckily he was working.  I took my water up to the counter and waited while he played with the tape roll on the machine. I had my wallet out so I could pay him when he was done.. Right there in my wallet was my standard military picture of my brother in front of the flag (most of you know he is serving outside Baghdad right now). He finished what he was working on and was extremely friendly to me as he rang up the water. I placed my wallet on the table and pointed to my brother and asked what he would do if he came in for a water (I couldn't help myself). As uncomfortable as it was with only the two of us in that small store he told me in what was a poor attempt of English that I give no water, no nothing to him, he may leave, his attitude completely changed. I was taken back, I couldn't believe what just happened. I closed my wallet and left my water on the counter and told him that if he must leave then I must leave too. I could not believe it. I sat in my car and didn't know whether to laugh at him or cry.  I guess the reason I'm telling you this is so you can make a decision on whether or not to give him your business. I guess that is why it's America, he is able to come to this country, own a small business tax free, and refuse business to anyone he wants. It is also our right to stop every person we know from EVER going there again and running his sorry a** out of town.",

Bush.  Steven J. Bosell, the owner of B & B Construction in Corona, California, has filed a lawsuit claiming emotional distress, personal injury and sexual disfunction after he wrapped his privates in duct tape to protect them from a biological attack.  After watching Mr. Ridge on television advising us to stock up on duct tape and plastic, I went to the local Costco and bought $100 worth of duct tape to protect myself, Bosell said. When I got home, I taped up my windows and doors. After I did that I realized if survivors like myself are going to reproduce and populate the Earth after a biological attack, we have to protect our privates as well.  Bosell claimed in his lawsuit he wrapped his privates in duct tape as test of Homeland Security. When he tried to remove the tape, Bosell injured himself when the tape began peeling off skin and body hair. After calling an ambulance, Bosell was taken to the hospital where the doctors and nurses laughed at him.  I told the doctors and nurses at the hospital if they laughed, I would file a lawsuit against them and the hospital. They laughed anyways and I now have another lawsuit pending Bosell said with tears streaming down his face. They went out their way to make me look like a fool. Once I saw the doctors scalpel go toward my privates, I totally lost it and blacked out.  Also named in the lawsuit is the President of the United States, George W. Bush. President Bush is just as liable for injury to my reproductive future because he hired Mr. Ridge to run the Department of Homeland Security and Mr. Ridge gave the nation bad advice. They also make me look like a fool. Bosell sobbed.",

Barack Hussein Obama had served 14-State Governors in the United States, National Security Letters (NSLs) warning that the Governor's actions in attempting to form State Defense Forces needs to be halted immediately or they will face arrest for the crime of treason. The employment of NSLs was authorized by the Patriot Act introduced by George W. Bush. Contained within the section related to these letters, it is forbidden for anyone receiving a NSL warning to even acknowledge the existence of said communication.  Obama is angered by the several State Governors who have reestablished State Defense Forces. These forces are described as: State Defense Forces (also known as State Guards, State Military Reserves, State Militias) in the United States are military units that operate under the sole authority of a state government they are not regulated by the National Guard Bureau nor are they part of the Army National Guard of the United States. State Defense Forces are authorized by state and federal law and are under the command of the governor of each state. State Defense Forces are distinct from their state’s National Guard in that they cannot become federal entities.  Mr. Obama is fearful of these State Defense Forces, in that he does not have control of said forces, and with the U.S. Military stretched to near breaking from multiple deployments and theatre actions in Iraq and Afghanistan, these State military forces would be under the direct command and authority of the Governors in which states have said forces. In essence, the Governors would have “de facto control” of the United States.  The two Governors leading this move are: Tim Pawlenty, Governor of Minnesota and Rick Perry, Governor of Texas.  Both of these State Governors stated they have: deep fear the President is destroying their Nation. Governor Pawlenty's fear of Obama is that since Obama took office he has appeased America's enemies and has shunned some of America's strongest allies, especially Israel. Governor Perry has declared that Obama is punishing his State of Texas by dumping tens-of-thousands of illegal Mexican immigrants into the cities and small towns of Texas.  Governor Perry further recently stated: If Barack Obama's Washington doesn't stop being so oppressive, Texans might feel compelled to renounce their American citizenry and secede from the union. NOT possible but would be great!  Obama fearing a revolution against him by the states, has moved swiftly by nationalizing nearly all National Guard Forces in multiple states Georgia, Alabama, Kansas, Minnesota, Tennessee, Virginia, Louisiana, South Carolina — to name a few. The Governors of the Great States of Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia still have under their Command-and-Control the State Defense Forces to go against U.S. Federal forces should the need arise. Also important to note: There are NO U.S. laws prohibiting National Guard troops from also joining their State's Defense Forces. This dilemma occurred during the Civil War with many citizen soldiers choosing to serve their states instead of the Federal Government.  This is a fluid and still developing situation that warrants close attention. ",

He didn't look promising, however, his first time at bat. He was tense and nervous. He swung at three pitches and missed each of them badly. His first time at bat and he didn't get within a foot of the ball. Slowly he walked to the dugout with his head down. He picked out a seat on the end of the bench and there his rested his head in his hands.  A player by the name of Joe Gordon was on that same Cleveland team. Joe was an outstanding second baseman. He batted right after Doby. Gordon had a good record batting against the pitcher who was on the mound that day. But something quite extraordinary was about to happen — the stuff of baseball legend. Joe Gordon went up to the plate and missed three pitches in a row — each of them by at least two feet. Then he walked slowly to the end of the bench and sat down next to Larry Doby. Then Joe Gordon slowly put his head in his hands.  Did Joe Gordon strike out that day deliberately? We will never know. However it is interesting to note that every time Larry Doby went out on the field from that day on, he first picked up Joe Gordon's glove and tossed it to him.",

That very day the lady cut her tongue on the envelope. A week later, she noticed an abnormal swelling of her tongue. She went to the doctor, and they found nothing wrong. Her tongue was not sore or anything. A couple of days later, her tongue started to swell more, and it began to get really sore, so sore, that she could not eat. She went back to the hospital, and demanded something be done. The doctor took an x-ray of her tongue and noticed a lump. He prepared her for minor surgery. When the doctor cut her tongue open, a live cockroach crawled out!!!! There were roach eggs on the seal of the envelope. The egg was able to hatch inside of her tongue, because of her saliva. It was warm and moist... This is a true story reported on CNN. Andy Hume wrote Hey, I used to work in an envelope factory. You wouldn't believe the things that float around in those gum applicator trays. I haven't licked an envelope for years! To All: I used to work for a print shop (32 years ago) and we were told NEVER to lick the envelopes. I never understood why until I had to go into storage and pull out 2500 envelops that were already printed for a customer who was doing a mailing and saw several squads of roaches roaming around inside a couple of boxes with eggs everywhere. They eat the glue on the envelopes. I think print shops have a harder time controlling roaches than a restaurant. I always buy the self sealing type. Or if need be I use a glue stick to seal one that has the type of glue that needs to be wet to stick. PLEASE PASS THIS ON TO YOUR FRIENDS. After reading this you will never lick another envelope or stamp ever again",

The author, Thomas Sowell, is black, and a highly respected writer. He is at Stanford University.  The current Occupy Wall Street movement is the best illustration to date of what President Barack Obama's America looks like. It is an America where the lawless, unaccomplished, ignorant and incompetent rule. It is an America where those who have sacrificed nothing pillage and destroy the lives of those who have sacrificed greatly. It is an America where history is rewritten to honor dictators, murderers and thieves. It is an America where violence, racism, hatred, class warfare and murder are all promoted as acceptable means of overturning the American civil society.  It is an America where humans have been degraded to the level of animals: defecating in public, having sex in public, devoid of basic hygiene. It is an America where the basic tenets of a civil society, including faith, family, a free press and individual rights, have been rejected. It is an America where our founding documents have been shredded and, with them, every person's guaranteed liberties.  It is an America where, ultimately, great suffering will come to the American people, but the rulers like Obama, Michelle Obama, Harry Reid, Nancy Pelosi, Barney Frank, Chris Dodd, Joe Biden, Jesse Jackson, Louis Farrakhan, liberal college professors, union bosses and other loyal liberal/Communist Party members will live in opulent splendor. It is the America that Obama and the Democratic Party have created with the willing assistance of the American media, Hollywood, unions, universities, the Communist Party of America, the Black Panthers and numerous anti-American foreign entities.  Obama has brought more destruction upon this country in four years than any other event in the history of our nation, but it is just the beginning of what he and his comrades are capable of. The Occupy Wall Street movement is just another step in their plan for the annihilation of America.  Socialism, in general, has a record of failure so blatant that only an intellectual could ignore or evade it. — Thomas Sowell  If ever a time should come, when vain and aspiring men shall possess the highest seats in Government, our country will stand in need of its experienced patriots to prevent its ruin. — Samuel Adams, 1780  If not now, when?

In the letter, Putin re-introduces Americans to some unpleasant facts about history and life they’d rather forget, such as Nixon’s reasoning behind massive carpet bombing of millions or North Vietnamese for the purpose of 'looking good' while exiting the war, and how Pakistan has been using the U.S. as a 'false ally' to gain foreign aid, while using the funds to embolden the Taliban in Afghanistan. He calls out Barrack Hussein Obama for having the audacity to meet with gay rights activists while he is in Russia next week, a group Putin despises, while refusing to carve away time to meet with him and solve the Syria issue. He compares the action to the equivalent of him (Putin) coming to the U.S. and meeting with Obama’s domestic enemy, the N.R.A.    How do I put this politely? You Americans are dumb. Today, Russia and America are fighting each other over fighting the Muslim radicals. Instead, we should be uniting to crush these violent Islamists, once and for all.  You Americans want to remove my ally, the Syrian leader Bashar Al-Assad. To borrow a phrase from your John F. Kennedy, Assad may be a son-of-a-bitch, but he’s my son-of-a-bitch.  So if you want to destroy him, what are you going to give me in return? If your answer is, We will give you nothing, well, why would I ever agree to that? That's not negotiation, that's dictation it's a return to the bad Yeltsin days, when Holy Mother Russia was pushed into the mud like a used whore. [Remainder of the letter can be viewed here.] ",

        "tweet": "Les pédophiles veulent les mêmes droits que les homosexuels Ils prétendent qu’il est injuste d’être stigmatisé à cause de son orientation sexuelle Utilisant les mêmes tactiques que les défenseurs des droits des « gays », des pédophiles commencent à vouloir un statut similaire en alléguant que le désir d’enfants est une orientation sexuelle peu différente de celle des hétérosexuels et des homosexuels. Les opposants au mœurs homosexuels ont longtemps prétendu qu’une fois acceptée la reconnaissance de l’homosexualité comme simple « mode de vie » ou orientation sexuelle différente, logiquement plus rien ne serait interdit. Les partisans des « gays » se sont offensés d’une telle position en affirmant que cela n’arriverait jamais. Des psychiatres commencent pourtant à prendre parti pour une nouvelle définition de la pédophilie comme cela fut fait pour l’homosexualité il y a plusieurs années. En 1973, l’Association américaine de psychiatrie (AAP) a déclassifié l’homosexualité de sa liste de désordres mentaux. Un groupe de psychiatres avec le B4U-Act (voir ces liens) a organisé récemment un symposium proposant une nouvelle définition de la pédophilie dans le Manuel de diagnostic et de statistiques des désordres mentaux de l’AAP. Le B4U-Act appelle pédophiles « les gens attirés par des mineurs ». Le site web de l’organisation déclare que son but est « d’aider les professionnels de la santé mentale à en apprendre davantage sur l’attirance pour les mineurs et envisager les effets de la banalisation, de la stigmatisation et de la peur ». En 1998 l’AAP a publié un rapport prétendant que « le potentiel négatif de relations sexuelles adulte-enfant était exagéré et qu’une majorité d’hommes et de femmes n’avait rapporté aucun effet sexuel négatif au travers d’expériences d’abus sexuels pendant l’enfance ». La pédophilie a déjà été octroyée d’un statut protégé par le gouvernement fédéral. La loi Matthew Shepard et James Byrd, Jr sur la prévention des crimes haineux répertorie « l’orientation sexuelle » comme une catégorie protégée , elle n’en définit pas pour autant le terme. Les républicains ont tenté d’ajouter un amendement spécifiant que « la pédophilie n’est pas considérée comme une orientation » , l’amendement a cependant été rejeté par les démocrates. Le républicain Alcee Hastings a exposé que tout mode de vie sexuel différent devrait être protégé par la loi. « Cette loi se réfère à notre résolution de mettre fin à la violence basée sur des préjugés et pour garantir que tout Américain, quelle que soient sa race, couleur, religion, origine, sexe, orientation sexuelle, identité sexuelle ou handicap ou tous ces “philies” et fétichismes et “ismes” affichés, ne doit pas vivre dans la peur de qui il est. Je presse mes collègues de voter en faveur de cette règle. » La Maison Blanche a appuyé la loi en disant que, « au fond, cela ne concerne pas que nos lois , cela concerne qui nous sommes en tant qu’individu. Cela concerne la valeur que nous nous accordons – si nous acceptons nos différences plutôt que de les autoriser à devenir une source d’animosité. » En début d’année, deux psychologues canadiens ont déclaré que la pédophilie est une orientation sexuelle exactement comme l’homosexualité ou l’hétérosexualité. Van Gijseghem, psychologue et ancien professeur à l’université de Montréal, a déclaré aux membres du Parlement : « Les pédophiles ne sont pas simplement des gens qui commettent un petit délit de temps en temps mais qui sont en proie à ce qui équivaut à une orientation sexuelle, exactement comme un autre individu peut être en proie à son hétérosexualité ou même son homosexualité. » Il continue en disant : « Les vrais pédophiles ont une préférence exclusive pour les enfants, ce qui revient au même que d’avoir une orientation sexuelle. On ne peut changer l’orientation sexuelle de cette personne. Elle peut, cependant, rester abstinente. » Quand on lui a demandé s’il comparait les pédophiles et les homosexuels, Van Gijseghem a répondu : « Si, par exemple, nous vivions dans une société où l’hétérosexualité était proscrite ou interdite et qu’on vous dise que vous devez faire une thérapie pour changer votre orientation sexuelle, vous diriez probablement que c’est un peu dingue. En d’autres mots, vous ne l’accepteriez pas du tout. J’utilise cette analogie pour dire qu’en effet les pédophiles ne changent pas leur orientation sexuelle. » Le Dr Quinsey, professeur émérite de psychologie à l’université de Queen à Kingston dans l’Ontario, est tombé d’accord avec Van Gijseghem. Quinsey a dit que les intérêts sexuels des pédophiles vont vers les enfants, et « il n’y a aucune preuve que ce type de préférence puisse être changé par un traitement ou quoi que ce soit d’autre ». En juillet, Harvard Publications Médicales a dit : « La pédophilie est une orientation sexuelle peu susceptible de changement. Un traitement vise à rendre quelqu’un capable de résister à agir selon ses pulsions sexuelles. » Linda Harvey, de Mission America, a dit que la pression en faveur de droits égaux pour les pédophiles va devenir de plus en plus courante car les groupes LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender : lesbien, homosexuel, bisexuel et transsexuel) continuent leurs revendications. « Tout cela fait partie d’un plan pour inciter à la sexualité des enfants de plus en plus jeunes , pour les convaincre qu’une amitié normale est en réalité une attirance sexuelle. »Milton Diamond, professeur à l’université d’Hawaï et directeur du Centre pacifique pour sexe et société, a déclaré que la pornographie infantile pourrait être bénéfique à la société parce que « les délinquants sexuels potentiels usent de la pornographie infantile comme d’un substitut à des relations sexuelles pédophiles ». Diamond est un conférencier distingué pour l’Institut de San Francisco pour études avancées de la sexualité humaine. Cet institut a plaidé ouvertement en faveur d’une abrogation de l’interdiction des homosexuels dans les forces armées. Il a établi sur son site une liste de « droits sexuels basiques » qui inclut « le droit de s’engager dans des actes sexuels ou des activités d’une quelconque nature, si tant est qu’elles n’impliquent pas d’actes sans consentement, violence, contrainte, coercition ou tromperie ». Un autre droit est « de vivre sans persécution, discrimination ou intervention sociale dans le comportement sexuel personnel » et « une liberté de pensée sexuelle, de fantasme ou de désir ». L’organisation dit aussi que personne ne devrait être « désavantagé en raison de son âge ». Des lois sur la délinquance sexuelle protégeant les enfants ont été contestées dans plusieurs états dont la Californie, la Georgie et l’Iowa. Les délinquants sexuels prétendent que les lois qui les empêchent de vivre près des écoles ou des parcs sont injustes car cela les pénalise pour la vie.",

These trees were then turned into mulch and the state is trying to get rid of tons and tons of this mulch to any state or company who will come and haul it away. So it will be showing up in Home Depot and Lowes at dirt cheap prices with one huge problem. Formosan Termites will be the bonus in many of those bags. New Orleans is one of the few areas in the country were the Formosan Termite has gotten a strong hold and most of the trees blown down were already badly infested with those termites. Now we may have the worst case of transporting a problem to all parts of the country that we have ever had. These termites can eat a house in no time at all and we have no good control against them, so tell your friends that own homes to avoid cheap mulch and know were it came from.",

        "tweet": "Subject: Be Alert & Cautious / Must read!! A man came over and offered his services as a painter to a female who was putting gas in her car and left his card. She said no, but accepted his card out of kindness and got in the car. The man then got into a car driven by another gentleman. As the lady left the service station, she saw the men following her out of the station at the same time. Almost immediately, she started to feel dizzy and could not catch her breath. She tried to open the window and realized that the odor was on her hand, the same hand which accepted the card from the gentleman at the gas station. She then noticed the men were immediately behind her and she felt she needed to do something at that moment. She drove into the first driveway and began to honk her horn repeatedly to ask for help. The men drove away but the lady still felt pretty bad for several minutes after she could finally catch her breath. Apparently, there was a substance on the card that could have seriously injured her. This drug is called 'BURUNDANGA' and it is used by people who wish to incapacitate a victim in order to steal from or take advantage of them like REPEATED GANG RAPE. This drug is four times more dangerous than the date rape drug and is transferable on simple cards. So take heed and make sure you don't accept cards at any given time alone or from someone on the streets. This applies to those making house calls and slipping you a card when they offer their services .PLEASE SEND THIS E-MAIL ALERT TO EVERY FEMALE YOU KNOW",

If the government gives benefits to 'illegal' aliens who have never contributed, where does that leave those of us who have paid into Social Security all our working lives?  As stated below, the Senate voted this week to allow 'illegal' aliens access to Social Security benefits. Attached is an opportunity to sign a petition that requires citizenship for eligibility to that social service.  Instructions are below. If you don't forward the petition and just stop it, we will lose all these names.  If you do not want to sign it, please just forward it to everyone you know.  Thank you!  To add your name, click on 'forward'. Address it to all of your email correspondents, add your name to the list and send it on.  When the petition hits 1,000, send it to comment@whitehouse.gov     PETITION for President Obama:  Dear Mr. President:  We, the undersigned, protest the bill that the Senate voted on recently which would allow illegal aliens to access our Social Security. We demand that you and all Congressional representatives require citizenship as a pre-requisite for social services in the United States.  We further demand that there not be any amnesty given to illegals, NO free services, no funding, no payments to and for illegal immigrants.  We are fed up with the lack of action about this matter and are tired of paying for services to illegals.",

You have a movie about SEALS within the past year trying to identify with me, with the navy SEALS, and with anything that might improve your polling numbers... and yet it is all a sham to hide a weak un-American man desperate to claim the victories of others for his own.  You Sir are trying to take the credit for what the American People have achieved in killing Bin Laden. Your use of the SEALs accomplishment as a campaign slogan is nothing less than despicable. I, as a former Navy SEAL do not accept your taking credit for Osama Bin Laden's death. The American Military accomplished that feat.  Yet now that it is useful, you Mr. President, continue to refer to the event as if it were YOU and you alone which accomplished the worthy task of slaying one of America's greatest enemies. You say I directed, I Continued, My Intelligence Community, My national security team, I determined that I had enough...., My direction...  Yet reliable sources continue to report that not only did you attempt to stop or delay Bin Laden's demise, you did not even leave the golf course for the situation room until 20 minutes before SEAL Team 6 took out Osama Bin Laden. Even the clothes you wore in the situation room betray this fact. This is a Commander in Chief? A man who takes credit for actions largely taken while he was out golfing?  We men who have taken the oath, say ENOUGH. You do not speak for me, a former Navy SEAL, or any one of the league of men whom I have earned the right to be among. You are simply a man running for an office. Yet you behave as a glory-hoarding ruler. You campaign to be our leader, yet in reality you wish to be our Master.  The American people are the ones who got Bin Laden... You did Not! We have fought wars and slugged it with Vast Terror Organizations to get to the man you say YOU killed. The United Sates of America has won you a title sir and you have spent the last three years trying to beg, borrow and bow as you GIVE IT ALL AWAY. You just happened to be president of the USA when WE THE PEOPLE got Osama Bin Laden. We do not see you as heroic or stoic, we see you as the guy who let America Go. We got fat and weak and you gave it all away. That is your credit - you bow to foreign leaders and pander to the press. You do not represent me as a Military Man. You do not represent me as a SEAL. You do not represent me as an AMERICAN!  You do not speak for me or any American military man because though you may now be Commander in Chief, you are not the man to whom we can point our sons and say This is the American dream, this is American exceptionalism, this is what I wish for your future, because you Sir are NONE of these things. You Sir, are the antithesis of American Exceptionalism. Your idols are Saul Alinksi and Karl Marx and your revolutionary dreams and anti-American ideals poison your every policy. Your every action betrays the fact that in your soul you do not understand what it is to be an American, not what America truly is. Your agenda from the beginning has been to get rid of and kill everything that is and ever was American. You who so easily dismisses America's greatness and bows to foreigners... YOU DO NOT SPEAK FOR ME. YOU DO NOT SPEAK FOR THE NAVY SEALS. YOU DO NOT SPEAK FOR THE MILITARY MAN AND you SHALL NOT claim as your prize that which you have not earned. The Navy SEALS are NOT a campaign slogan to be bantered about for play. Nor are our accomplishments, including the demise of Osama Bin Laden, yours to claim. So you DO NOT speak for me. And I will not stand for your use and abuse of my brethren the SEALS.  For Liberty,  Benjamin Smith",

Now, as an Infantry Marine, I'm constantly in a combat zone — it may not always be popping off, but for them to take that away from us is bullshit. Now, the aviation tech who sits on Camp Leatherneck, sure, I can see him not getting Combat Pay, but to take it away from the grunts, the ground pounders, the front line of defense ... come on, Uncle Sam.

Their house burned down...nothing left but ashes. They have good insurance, so the home will be replaced and most of the contents. That is the good news. However, they were sick when they found out the cause of the fire. The insurance investigator sifted through the ashes for several hours. He had the cause of the fire traced to the master bathroom. He asked my sister-in-law what she had plugged in in the bathroom. She listed the normal things. ...curling iron,blow dryer. He kept saying to her, No, this would be something that would disintegrate at high temperatures. Then, my sister-in-law remembered she had a Glade Plug-in in the bathroom. The investigator had one of those Aha moments. He said that was the cause of the fire. He said he has seen more home fires started with the plug in type room fresheners than anything else. He said the plastic they are made from is a THIN plastic. He said in every case there was nothing left to prove that it even existed. When the investigator looked in the wall plug, the two prongs left from the plug-in were still in there. My sister-in-law had one of the plug-ins that had a small night light built in it. She said she had noticed that the light would dim....and then finally go out. She would walk in a few hours later, and the light would be back on again. The Investigator said that the unit was getting too hot, and would dim and go out rather than just blow the light bulb. Once it cooled down, it would come back on. That is a warning sign. The investigator said he personally wouldn't have any type of plug in fragrance device anywhere in his house. He has seen too many burned down homes. Thought I would warn you all. I had several of them plugged in my house. I immediately took them all down.",

It donated $100,000 to the president's inauguration festivities.  The Enron chairman stayed at the White House 11 times. The corporation had access to the administration at its highest levels and even enlisted the Commerce and State Departments to grease deals for it.

Ants soon got to him and some ants in fact crawled into his ear which somehow managed to go to his brain. When he woke up, he did not realize that ants had gone to his head.  After that, he constantly complained about itchiness around his face. His mother brought him to a doctor, but the doctor could not figure out what was wrong with him. He took an X-ray of the boy and to his horror he found a group of live ants in his skull. Since the ants were still alive, the doctor could not operate on him because the ants were constantly moving around. The boy finally died. So please be careful when leaving food stuff near your bed or when eating in bed. This might attract ants. Most importantly, NEVER you or your child eat sweets before going to bed. You or your child might attract ants while you are asleep.  Incident Two: Another similar incident happened in a hospital in Taiwan. This man was warded in the hospital and was constantly warned by the nurses not to leave food stuff by his bedside because there were ants about. He did not heed their advice. Ants finally got to him. His family members said that the man constantly complained about headaches. He died and a postmortem or autopsy was done on him. Doctors found a group of live ants in his head. Apparently, the ants had been eating bits of his brain. So friends, better be safe than sorry. Never leave food stuff beside your bed you when you go to sleep.",

The mind-boggling drama unfolded, say cops, while Daniel Greene was attending his bachelor party at the Pretty Kitty strip club.  The club had been rented out for the private affair.  According to investigators, Greene was enjoying a lap dance when disaster struck: One of the strippers, Kandy Kane, got too into her performance and suffocated the man between her 72-DD breasts.  Witnesses said that Greene had had his fair share of beer, but didn't seem out-of-control.  When the song I'm Too Sexy began to play, Greene became excited and began to dance on the tabletop, hooting and hollering, pals said, like an idiot.  Miss Kane, apparently pleased to see someone enjoying her choice in music, moved in closer.  When Greene took his seat, she began giving him a lap dance, shaking her breasts in his face.  The more she shook, the deeper Greene got lost in her cleavage.  Daniel was having so much fun, partygoer John Gillman said. We all thought he loved being in that gal's chest.  Who could have known that when he was waving his hands around, he was signaling for help?  Cheering onlookers eventually realized that Greene was no longer moving, and pulled him from between Miss Kane's breasts.  Now Greene's family is suing Miss Kane and the Pretty Kitty for wrongful death.  Greene's father, George, won't specify the amount they are suing for, but claims that it isn't about the money.  Those breasts were lethal weapons, he told reporters.  The Pretty Kitty should not have allowed Miss Kane to have her bust enhanced to the size that she did.  We hope that by filing this lawsuit, we can send a message to other strippers: keep your bra size within a reasonable range.  Kandy Kane made a statement through her attorneys: I thought he liked it in there.   The Pretty Kitty declined comment.",

I just got information from a health seminar that I would like to share.  The leading cause of breast cancer is the use of anti-perspirant.  What? Yes ANTI-PERSPIRANT. Most of the products out there are an anti-perspirant/deodorant combination so go home and check your labels.  Deodorant is fine, anti-perspirant is not. Here's why:  The human body has a few areas that it uses to purge toxins behind the knees, behind the ears, groin area, and armpits. The toxins are purged in the form of perspiration.  Anti-perspirant, as the name clearly indicates, prevents you from perspiring, thereby inhibiting the body from purging toxins from below the armpits. These toxins do not just magically disappear. Instead, the body deposits them in the lymph nodes below the arms since it cannot sweat them out. This causes a high concentration of toxins and leads to cell mutations: a.k.a. CANCER. Nearly all breast cancer tumors occur in the upper outside quadrant of the breast area. This is precisely where the lymph nodes are located.  Additionally, men are less likely (but not completely exempt) to develop breast cancer prompted by anti-perspirant usage because most of the anti-perspirant product is caught in their hair and is not directly applied to the skin. Women who apply anti-perspirant right after shaving increase the risk further because shaving causes almost imperceptible nicks in the skin which give the chemicals entrance into the body from the armpit area.  PLEASE pass this along to anyone you care about. Breast Cancer is becoming frighteningly common. This awareness may save lives. If you are skeptical about these findings, I urge you to do some research for yourself. You will arrive at the same conclusions, I assure you.",

It was still light outside and I parked fairly close to the entrance. As I got out of my car and began walking towards Target, an older lady shouted to me from the passenger seat of a car about 30 feet away from me... ma'am you must help me, help me please, help me ma'am! I looked at her in the eyes and started to walk towards her when all of a sudden I remembered an email my mom sent me a week or two ago (one of those forwards about safety that you generally delete, or at least I do) about rapists and abductions using elderly people to lure women in.  I paused, memorized the license plate and immediately headed into Target to get a manager to come help this lady, just in case something was up. While the woman manager headed out there I kept a close watch just because I was curious what was wrong with the lady and wanted to be sure nothing happened. The target lady got very close to the old woman in order to help her do something.  Just then the back door flies open and a large man with a stocking cap on jumps out and sticks a gun to the lady's stomach as he shoves her into the back of the car. I yelled call 911 several times and just as I was saying that a policeman who happened to be on the other side of the parking lot and saw the entire thing happen, raced over to the car. He was able to stop the car and arrest the male AS WELL AS THE old lady, who was involved in the scheme.  By God's grace everyone was alright, including myself, although I think we were both very shaken up. Like many of you, I would not in a million years have left an elderly person who was yelling for help if it weren't for the email I had read last week. SO, I wanted to pass this along so you all can be aware and remember that you really can't trust anyone these days. You just never know when something like this could happen. I would have never dreamed it to happen to me especially on a Sunday afternoon at a Target in a safe area!  It definitely was not coincidence that my mom sent me that email just a few days before this all happened. Please, PLEASE be careful and always be aware of your surroundings. Just because you individually don't go over to help someone doesn't mean you have to leave them in trouble, but please don't go alone, you really don't know what might be going on. ",

IT WILL TAKE FIVE MINUTES OF YOUR TIME AND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO IMPACT PEOPLE'S LIVES FOREVER! THANKS!!  Please read the below that was forwarded...it is pretty scary.  gloria sent this to me...this was sent to her from a coworker at CNN...i'm not sending this to freak everybody out...but just try to be careful...  Hi all I hope everyone is doing well. The reason I am sending out this mass email to everyone is because of something that was brought to my attention the other day that I feel I need to tell as many people as possible in case it turns out to be true.. One of my colleagues has a good family friend who works in city hall. This friend called my coworker on Friday to tell him about some intelligence the city has gotten regarding a possible terror attack in the city (most likely the subways) planned for this Friday and urged him to avoid the subways if possible. He also told him something about the city placing an order for 2 to 3 thousand extra body bags. Now you have to take these things with a grain of salt because I am sure they get tons of this intelligence that turns out to be nothing. However there are some things that coinside with this Friday that seem to give it a higher probability than usual. The terrorists attacked the WTC on 9/11. They attacked Spain's subways on 3/11. This Friday just happens to be 6/11 (thank GOD I'll be on a plane that day!).  Whether that means anything or not who knows. The thing that really has me concerned however is that all of a sudden a lot of things are now closed on Friday due to Reagan's death. The stock market, banks, Mail and all federal buildings are closed. Obviously Reagan's death wasn't planned but the fact they chose Friday as the day to do this big honoring of him strikes me as a little to coincidental (less people going to work = less people on the subway). The question that I get most when I tell people about this is why wouldn't they go on TV and warn people. Well I think the answer to that is simple....they can't.  They would cause mass hysteria and the city would be out of control. Take this information and do with it what you want. I just felt the need to tell as many people as I could. God forbid something does happen this Friday and some people get hurt or die that I know and could have warned about it and didn't, well that would be a tough pill for me to swallow. I hope all this is bull and nothing happens this Friday or any day for that matter. One thing is for certain though if I have to work on Friday I am taking a cab.",

However it happens, every smoker occasionally lights the wrong end of his or her cigarette, inhales one nasty lungfull of burning filter, curses, throws the now useless thing to the ground, and lights up a fresh smoke.  It is unpleasant, annoying, and embarrassing ... but scientists now believe inhaling the burning fumes from a cigarette filter can cause genital dysfunction in males and females.  Cigarette filters contain a chemical known as tralfamadoraphyl that is generally harmless ... unless it is burned and its fumes inhaled. Tralfamadoraphyl fumes build up in the body over time with each incorrectly lit cigarette, and eventually can restrict the flow of blood to the genitals of both sexes. It is estimated that if an individual were to incorrectly light one cigarette a month, it may take three or four years for the side effects to become recognizable.  Cigarette manufacturers are not made to warn the smoking public of this threat to their health because, as one tobacco executive has stated, If our product is used in the way it has been intended, this will not be a problem.  So, it is up to us. Pass this along to all the smokers in your life, and to the nonsmokers who have friends and relatives who smoke. They will thank you.",

La police a ouvert une enquête suite à la publication, jeudi 2 octobre, sur Facebook de photos de musulmans radicaux à l’entraînement. Ce n’est pas la première fois que les Ardennes sont concernées. L’an dernier, la forêt des Epioux accueillait des apprentis djihadistes. Des musulmans radicaux seraient en train de s’entraîner au djihad dans le sud des Ardennes belges. L’information est révélée ce vendredi matin par nos confrères de SudInfo. « C’est inquiétant et ne ressemble en rien à une simple partie de paintball entre amis, mais d’avantage à un camp d’entraînement radical », a expliqué la police à nos confrères. Ce sont des photos postées, jeudi 2 octobre sur Facebook, par Abd Al Wadoud Abu Daoud, un musulman radical bruxellois prêchant en faveur du salafisme, qui ont attiré l’attention des policiers. L’homme serait lié à la famille Elouassaki dont deux frères sont déjà partis se battre en Syrie.",

Ludwig lived most of his adult life in Connecticut. His SSN begins with the digits 042, which are among those reserved for Connecticut residents. Obama never lived or worked in that state, so there is no reason for his SSN to start with the digits 042.  Now comes the best part. Ludwig spent the final months of his life in Hawaii, where he died. Conveniently, Obama's grandmother, Madelyn Payne Dunham, worked part-time in the Probate Office in the Honolulu Hawaii Courthouse, and therefore had access to the SSNs of deceased individuals. The Social Security Administration was never informed of Ludwig's death, and because he never received Social Security benefits there were no benefits to stop and no questions were raised. The suspicion, of course, is that Dunham, knowing her grandson was not a U.S. citizen — either because he was born in Kenya or became a citizen of Indonesia upon his adoption by Lolo Soetoro — merely scoured the probate records until she found someone who died who was not receiving Social Security benefits, and selected that SSN for Obama.",

Yes, I am black, and I can say nigger, because I understand the true meaning of the word. Let's clear up a few things about the Michael Brown incident. -Fact: It is not called shoplifting or stealing, it's called robbery, which is a felony. Brown stole something and assaulted someone, that means ROBBERY. It's on video, and it's a fact. Not shoplifting, not theft, not lifting a few cigars, but ROBBERY! -Michael Brown, like Trayvon, was portrayed by the media as a little black boy, cute little headphones, and his cap and gown photo, gunned down by a ruthless police assassin, executed by whitey. First, I have never seen a cop drag a person into their car's driver door to arrest them. So, let us be clear, Michael Brown was a nigger a sorry assed, criminal, hoodlum, nigger. Nobody wants to say that, but I will. He had a criminal record a mile long, was known for numerous assaults, robberies, including the one you saw with your own eyes, and still refuse to call it a robbery. He was, like so many others, living a life that he thought he was entitled to, just for being alive. Gangsta rap, weed, drinking, guns, and those stupid-assed low profile rims, makes him some kind of bad-ass nigger. -I have fought communist Chinese and North Korean soldiers in the 1950's with more honor than that nigger. Yep, I peeled potatoes and shot communists. That's the only job a nigger soldier could get.",

Cette islamisation de la sphère publique est relayée par les médias et l’industrie de la grande distribution. Pour eux, l’audience et le business sont les seuls critères de l’un des phénomènes de l’immigration de masse sur le continent européen. Ainsi, la chaîne britannique Channel 4 diffusera chaque matin l’appel à la prière pendant le jeûne du ramadan, une première au Royaume-Uni pour une chaîne grand public. En France, Leader Price publie une nouvelle fois un catalogue estampillé « ramadan » et souhaite un « ramadan karim » (un « bon ramadan ») en arabe. Quant à Monoprix, l’enseigne des bobos met en avant des publicités « Spécial ramadan » où sont représentés des minarets et mosquées (photo), à destination des clients tunisiens. Mais pour un site de « consommateurs musulmans » comme Al Kanz, certains industriels ne vont pas assez loin en axant leurs campagnes sur les « saveurs orientales » plutôt que sur la fête religieuse du ramadan. Le lobbying musulman en veut toujours plus.",

ANNOUNCEMENT  The English are feeling the pinch in relation to recent terrorist threats and have therefore raised their security level from Miffed to Peeved.  Soon, though, security levels may be raised yet again to Irritated or even A Bit Cross. The English have not been A Bit Cross since the blitz in 1940 when tea supplies nearly ran out. Terrorists have been re-categorized from Tiresome to A Bloody Nuisance. The last time the British issued a Bloody Nuisance warning level was in 1588, when threatened by the Spanish Armada.  The Scots have raised their threat level from Pissed Off to Let's get the Bastards. They don't have any other levels. This is the reason they have been used on the front line of the British army for the last 300 years. The French government announced yesterday that it has raised its terror alert level from Run to Hide. The only two higher levels in France are Collaborate and Surrender. The rise was precipitated by a recent fire that destroyed France's white flag factory, effectively paralyzing the country's military capability.  Italy has increased the alert level from Shout Loudly and Excitedly to Elaborate Military Posturing. Two more levels remain: Ineffective Combat Operations and Change Sides.  The Germans have increased their alert state from Disdainful Arrogance to Dress in Uniform and Sing Marching Songs. They also have two higher levels: Invade a Neighbor and Lose.  Belgians, on the other hand, are all on holiday as usual the only threat they are worried about is NATO pulling out of Brussels.  The Spanish are all excited to see their new submarines ready to deploy. These beautifully designed subs have glass bottoms so the new Spanish navy can get a really good look at the old Spanish navy.  Americans meanwhile and as usual are carrying out pre-emptive strikes, on all of their allies, just in case.  And in the southern hemisphere...  New Zealand has also raised its security levels - from baaa to BAAAA!. Due to continuing defense cutbacks (the airforce being a squadron of spotty teenagers flying paper aeroplanes and the navy some toy boats in the Prime Minister's bath), New Zealand only has one more level of escalation, which is I hope Australia will come and rescue us.  Australia, meanwhile, has raised its security level from No worries to She'll be right, mate. Three more escalation levels remain: Crikey!', I think we'll need to cancel the barbie this weekend and The barbie is cancelled. So far no situation has ever warranted use of the final escalation level.",

Il faut bien que l’Etat récompense ses fidèles sujets et les délinquants en sont, surtout pour nos élites mondialisées. Ainsi, à leurs sortis de prisons nos récidivistes en puissance, reçoivent chaque mois une petite pension afin de les aider à se réinsérer ou plutôt de l’aider à recommencer leurs vies passées. Toutes les statistiques démontrant que la récidive est le lot de la plupart de ces voyous. Ils touchent donc de l’Etat 879,84€ par mois d’allocation temporaire d’attente, celle-ci peut aller jusqu’à 1540€ par mois suivant le nombre d’enfants que déclare le contrevenant. Bien entendu cette allocation est cumulable avec toutes les autres, toutes celles que nos gouvernants ont créé afin de rendre les citoyens de ce pays les plus assistés possibles. A moins que notre législateur pense qu’en versant une somme plus que conséquente au regard du nombre de retraités français étant au minimum vieillesse malgré une vie de travail ? S’il le pense c’est une erreur idéologique très grave. Nos bandits se fichent des 879,84€ versées par mois, bien entendu ils prendront mais cela n’empêchera pas de continuer à vivre dans l’illégalité. La récidive a deux causes, la première est la permissivité excessive de nos gouvernants engendrant l’impunité totale de nos délinquants. Parce que ceux-ci sont persuadés et nous ne pouvons leur donner tort qu’ils n’auront pas de sanction après leurs méfaits ou si peu qu’ils se permettent de répandre le mal. La deuxième erreur est de vouloir réinsérer des gens qui ne peuvent l’être, nos grands-mères qui ont souvent du bon sens nous disaient qu’un arbre tordu ne pouvait plus pousser droit. Il en va de même pour les hommes et femmes qui ont choisi cette vie. Ils ne redeviendront jamais d’honnêtes citoyens, leurs places est donc à l’écart des français. C’est pourquoi l’être humain avait créé la prison, pour que des dangers publics ne puissent vivre avec tout un chacun, et non pour rééduquer. Ce n’est pas le rôle de la société. Les américains l’ont bien compris après l’explosion phénoménale de leur criminalité des années 60 aux années 90. Ils ont ainsi choisis d’enfermer 2,5 millions de personnes, par cette politique courageuse ils ont divisé par 2 le nombre de crimes et délits. S’ils n’avaient pas une législation qu’à titre personnel je désapprouve sur les armes peut-être auraient-ils pu diviser par 3. Nos gouvernants eux ont décidé de laisser libre et de subventionner à outrance. Cette politique est un échec complet pourtant elle est chaque année accentuée. Un peu comme ces fédéralistes européens qui expliquent que l’Union ne fonctionne pas car pas assez d’Europe, Mme Taubira nous dira droit dans les yeux que la criminalité augmente en France car ils ne sont pas assez libre et surtout pas assez payés. C’est le monde à l’envers.",

The girls don't want to step over the man so they occupy the two end seats. When the movie starts with the sudden sound check the man awakens startledly and spills soda on one of the girls. When she, with authority, gets up to wipe herself off, the man trips her and she falls over the balcony to her death.

The Bill (House Bill No.1827) amends Title 75 of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statues and was passed on September 11, 2007.  The Bill states that No driver shall operate any moving vehicle on a highway of this Commonwealth, which shall include Federal, State and municipal highways, while using a handheld mobile telephone. The term handheld mobile telephone is defined by the bill as: A mobile telephone other than a hands-free mobile telephone with which a user engages in a call using at least one hand. It also defines hands-free mobile telephone as follows:  A mobile telephone that has an internal feature or function, or that is equipped with an attachment or addition, whether or not permanently part of such mobile telephone, by which a user engages in a call without the use of either hand, whether or not the use of either hand is necessary to activate, deactivate or initiate a function of such telephone. The new law does not apply, however to the following, when on duty and acting in their official capacities: *Law Enforcement Officers * Operators of Emergency Vehicles The bill also mentions that defensible actions for the use of a handheld mobile telephone will be: * The driver had reason to fear for the driver's safety * Reporting a traffic accident * Making a 911 emergency call A person who is found to be in violation of this section commits a summary offense and upon conviction, will be sentenced to pay a $50 fine.Screen shot of PDF version",

Neal Boortz, a Texan, lawyer, Texas Aggie, now nationally syndicated talk show host from Atlanta is an exception. Agree or not you will find his views thought provoking. It would have been particularly entertaining to have witnessed the faculty's reaction.     Commencement Address  I am honored by the invitation to address you on this august occasion. It's about time. Be warned, however, that I am not here to impress you you'll have enough smoke blown your way today. And you can bet your tassels I'm not here to impress the faculty and administration.  You may not like much of what I have to say, and that's fine. You will remember it though. Especially after about 10 years out there in the real world. This, it goes without saying, does not apply to those of you who will seek your careers and your fortunes as government employees.  This gowned gaggle behind me is your faculty. You've heard the old saying that those who can - do. Those who can't - teach. That sounds deliciously insensitive. But there is often raw truth in insensitivity, just as you often find feel-good falsehoods and lies in compassion. Say good-bye to your faculty because now you are getting ready to go out there and do. These folks behind me are going to stay right here and teach.  By the way, just because you are leaving this place with a diploma doesn't mean the learning is over. When an FAA flight examiner handed me my private pilot's license many years ago, he said, 'Here, this is your ticket to learn.' The same can be said for your diploma. Believe me, the learning has just begun.  Now, I realize that most of you consider yourselves Liberals. In fact, you are probably very proud of your liberal views. You care so much. You feel so much. You want to help so much. After all, you're a compassionate and caring person, aren't you now? Well, isn't that just so extraordinarily special. Now, at this age, is as good a time as any to be a Liberal as good a time as any to know absolutely everything. You have plenty of time, starting tomorrow, for the truth to set in. Over the next few years, as you begin to feel the cold breath of reality down your neck, things are going to start changing pretty fast .. including your own assessment of just how much you really know.

Actor Adam Sandler is reported to have died shortly after a snowboard accident earlier today - October 13, 2013.  The actor & novice snowboarder was vacationing at the Zermatt ski resort in Zermatt, Switzerland with family and friends. Witnesses indicate that Adam Sandler lost control of his snowboard and struck a tree at a high rate of speed.  Adam Sandler was air lifted by ski patrol teams to a local hospital, however, it is believed that the actor died instantly from the impact of the crash. The actor was wearing a helmet at the time of the accident and drugs and alcohol do not appear to have played any part in his death.",

God created everything? The professor asked.  Yes sir, the student replied.  The professor answered, If God created everything, then God created evil since evil exists, and according to the principal that our works define who we are then God is evil. The student became quiet before such an answer. The professor was quite pleased with himself and boasted to the students that he had proven once more that the Christian faith was a myth.  Another student raised his hand and said, Can I ask you a question professor?  Of course, replied the professor.  The student stood up and asked, Professor, does cold exist?  What kind of question is this? Of course it exists. Have you never been cold? The students snickered at the young man's question.  The young man replied, In fact sir, cold does not exist. According to the laws of physics, what we consider cold is in reality the absence of heat. Every body or object is susceptible to study when it has or transmits energy, and heat is what makes a body or matter have or transmit energy. Absolute zero (-460 degrees F) is the total absence of heat all matter becomes inert and incapable of reaction at that temperature. Cold does not exist. We have created this word to describe how we feel if we have no heat.  The student continued, Professor, does darkness exist?  The professor responded, Of course it does.  The student replied, Once again you are wrong sir, darkness does not exist either. Darkness is in reality the absence of light. Light we can study, but not darkness. In fact we can use Newton's prism to break white light into many colors and study the various wavelengths of each color. You cannot measure darkness. A simple ray of light can break into a world of darkness and illuminate it. How can you know how dark a certain space is? You measure the amount of light present. Isn't this correct? Darkness is a term used by man to describe what happens when there is no light present.  Finally the young man asked the professor, Sir, does evil exist?  Now uncertain, the professor responded, Of course as I have already said. We see it every day. It is in the daily example of man's inhumanity to man. It is in the multitude of crime and violence everywhere in the world. These manifestations are nothing else but evil.  To this the student replied, Evil does not exist sir, or at least it does not exist unto itself. Evil is simply the absence of God. It is just like darkness and cold, a word that man has created to describe the absence of God. God did not create evil. Evil is not like faith, or love that exist just as does light and heat. Evil is the result of what happens when man does not have God's love present in his heart. It's like the cold that comes when there is no heat or the darkness that comes when there is no light.  The professor sat down.  The young man's name — Albert Einstein.",

Le panga est, au Vietnam, un poisson de culture industrielle intensive , plus exactement, il vient du delta du Mekong, et il est en train d'envahir le marché à cause de son prix. Voici ce qu'il y a à savoir sur le panga : le *Mekong* est l'un des fleuves les plus contaminés de la planète. Les pangas sont infectés, à hauts niveaux, de venins et bactéries (arsenic, résidus industriels toxiques et dangereux, sous-produits du secteur industriel en pleine croissance), métaux contaminés, phénols polychlorés (PCB) ou DDT et leurs (DDTs), chlorate , des composants relationnés (CHLs), hexachlorociloxane, isomères (HCHs) et hexachlorobenzène (HCB). Il sont alimentés avec des poissons morts, des restes d'os et avec une farine d'Amérique du Sud, le manioc et des résidus de soja et graines. Il est évident que ce type d'alimentation peu salubre n'a rien à voir avec l'alimentation d'un environnement naturel. Cela ressemble beaucoup à l'alimentation des vaches folles (vaches qui furent alimentées avec des vaches. Vous en rappelez-vous ?). L'alimentation des pangas est complètement en dehors de toute réglementation judiciaire. Le panga grandit 4 fois plus vite que dans la nature, à l'état normal. De plus, les pangas sont injectés avec (PEE). Quelques scientifiques ont découvert que si l'on injectait les femelles panga avec des hormones féminines dérivées d'urine déshydratée de femmes enceintes, la femelle panga produirait ses oeufs plus rapidement et en grande quantité, ce qui n'arriverait pas dans un environnement naturel (une femelle panga arrive ainsi à produire 500.000 oeufs en une fois). De fait, ce sont des poissons qui ont des hormones injectables (produites par une entreprise *pharmaceutique chinoise* pour accélérer le processus de croissance et de reproduction. En achetant du panga, nous collaborons avec des entreprises gigantesques sans aucun scrupule et spéculatrices, qui ne se préoccupent pas de *la santé et du bien être des êtres humains*. Ce commerce est accepté par de *grandes superficies_* qui vendent au public en général, tout en sachant qu'ils vendent des *produits contaminés.* *NOTE: Etant donné la prodigieuse quantité de pangas disponible, ils termineront également dans d'autres aliments : surimi (ces petits batônnets faits avec de la chair de poisson), poisson en boîte et probablement dans quelques aliments pour animaux (chiens et chats).* *REGARDEZ LA PROVENANCE DU POISSON ET N'ACHETEZ JAMAIS DE POISSON ASIATIQUE AUSSI PEU CHER QU'IL SOIT.* *CARREFOUR ET EXITO NE SE PREOCCUPERONT JAMAIS DE VOTRE SANTE !!!* *FAITES SUIVRE ...*",

I don't know if it's true or not, but this is one Christian who is standing up and saying that the Liberals and Atheists can just go watch something else while Duck Dynasty is on. They got their way by taking God out of our schools and everywhere else. Isn't that enough greed? Stop trying to RUN this show!     Found this quote on Facebook. I would like to know if it is true:  The Liberals and Atheists are given A&E alot of problems because of Duck Dynasty family dinner Prayer and the constant presence of guns.

He said, Guns and God are apart of our everyday lives and to remove either of them from the show is unacceptable. Well A&E, do you want the #1 show on TV or you gonna cave in to those Liberals and Atheists? I'm sure another channel will pick them up. Also Phil insisted that the show would air at 9PM central time so it would not conflict with the viewer's Wednesday Night Church Services. The contract was agreed upon and signed by A&E yesterday for another season and it will remain being produced according to Phil Robertson and on his terms.",

Les immigrés de plus de 65 ans arrivant en France bénéficient automatiquement d’une pension retraite de plus de 700 euros quand bien même ils n’ont jamais travaillé ou cotisé… Un scandale au regard des pensions de misère que touchent certaines catégories socio-professionnelles. Les montants des retraites auxquelles ont droit les personnes retraitées immigrant en France pour quelque raison que ce soit, s’élèvent à 709 euros pour un célibataire et 1157 euros pour un couple ! Des chiffres à mettre en perspective avec les pensions touchées par la majorité des agriculteurs ayant travaillé 42 annuités et qui sont souvent largement inférieures… Tout comme celles de nombreux commerçants, artisans, ouvriers et même employés ! Le gouvernement français privilégie donc le financement de retraites de personnes n’ayant jamais travaillé ou contribué à l’économie nationale, plutôt que de travailler à augmenter les petites retraites de ceux (Français ou étrangers) ayant œuvré à la création de richesse dans notre pays. Ce dispositif aberrant est vanté noir sur blanc dans le livret d’accueil « Vivre en France » diffusé par le ministère de l’Immigration aux nouveaux arrivants. C’est à se taper la tête contre les murs : il suffit à une personne d’au moins 65 ans qui arrive en France d’aller tranquillement frapper à la porte des services sociaux pour avoir immédiatement droit à 709 euros par mois, voire 1 157 euros si elle vit en couple. Cette situation est très injuste vis-à-vis des retraités français ou ayant cotisé en France, qui voient dans le même temps leurs pensions constamment rabotées au fur et à mesure que leurs caisses s’enfoncent dans le rouge. Si l’on ajoute à cela que la Cnav verse des pensions à l’étranger sans aucun contrôle, au point que la Cour des comptes dénonce le versement de pensions à des morts, notamment en Algérie (mais sans proposer le moindre remède), on ne peut que constater que notre système de retraites est ouvert à tous vents : prestations injustifiées, fraudes etc.",

Mohammed Moussaoui, Président du C.F.C.M (Conseil Français du Culte Musulman)  Monsieur Moussaoui La Publication du Numéro de “Charlie Hebdo” représentant Mahomet vient de donner lieu une fois encore à des Représailles lamentables de la part d’individus décidément bien peu éclairés que, au titre de Président du C.F.C.M, vous avez le Devoir de canaliser .. Dans “Le Monde” paru ce Mercredi vous affirmez ne pas voir de lien entre les Elections en Tunisie et en Libye et l’Outrage caricatural nous rappelant tant bien que mal ce qu’est la Charia, ou tout au moins sa partie la plus spectaculaire pour le Citoyen Français de base peu au fait de ce qui se passe sur son Sol. Je vous tiens pour quelqu’un d’intelligent et de cultivé.  Vous devez donc savoir qu’en France la Caricature est une Tradition très ancienne et un Art très prisé, qu’aucun Sujet n’y échappe et surtout pas un Sujet d’Actualité, et l’Instauration de la Charia sur un Sol resté longtemps Laïque est un Sujet suffisamment grave et inquiétant pour ne pas faillir à la Règle. La Charia, l’Islam, n’ont pas à faire exception à cette Règle. La Charia est un Système Archaïque fondé il y a 14 Siècles, profondément odieux, sexiste, rétrograde, discriminant et antidémocratique. Dénoncer ce Système par la Caricature est un Procédé visant à en montrer toute l’Abjection. Condamner la Charia, Monsieur, est un Acte de Salubrité Publique nécessaire à la Démocratie dont vous profitez puisque c’est en France que vous vivez en toute Liberté. Jouiriez-vous de la même Liberté au Maroc ou en Algérie ? J’en doute fort, sinon comment expliquer la Présence aussi énorme de Marocains abandonnant le Maroc ou l’Algérie pour la France ? C’est bien que l’air y est plus doux et plus libre ici. Cette Charia, prônée par Le Coran et faisant Partie intégrante de l’Islam (le Coran est la Base de l’Islam, l’Islamisme n’en étant que son Expression la plus spectaculairement virulente), il est hautement souhaitable de s’en inquiéter, d’autant qu’une bonne partie de ceux qui ont permis ce Désastre antidémocratique vivent sur notre Sol et que des Elus « dhimmis » comme les nomme votre Dogme, appellent de leurs voix le Droit de ces Promoteurs Chariamistes de se présenter à des Élections avec les Conséquences terribles qu’on imagine. Vous déclarez que Pour les Musulmans, le simple fait de caricaturer le Prophète est, en soi, inacceptable et blessant. Blessant, je le conçois, mais inacceptable ? Ce qui est inacceptable, c’est d’interdire le Divorce, y compris en France. Ce qui est inacceptable, c’est d’autoriser la Polygamie, y compris en France. Ce qui est inacceptable, c’est de Considérer que la Femme est inférieure à l’homme,” y compris en France.” Ce qui est inacceptable, c’est d’Enfermer les Femmes sous des Linceuls noirs, y compris en France. Ce qui est inacceptable, c’est de Refuser à la Femme d’épouser l’homme de son choix, pour lui faire épouser celui que sa famille a choisi pour elle,y compris en France. Ce qui est inacceptable, c’est qu’il existe un Conseil Européen de la Recherche et de la Fatwa décrétant les Fatwas ayant pour Vocation d’être appliquées en France. En France, Aucune Loi ne punit le Blasphème, comme l’a d’ailleurs démontré la récente Affaire du Coran brûlé, et qui a vu la relaxe de l’Incendiaire. En conséquence en France, Monsieur Moussaoui, il est permis de brûler un Coran si on le souhaite, et de Caricaturer et de se moquer d’un Prophète, fût-il le vôtre. Les différentes Manifestations Hostiles à cette Publication de Charlie Hebdo n’ont pas manqué de fleurir sur les Forums, certains insultant copieusement les Français, d’autres réclamant à grands Cris des Caricatures de juifs de 40, ce qui semble assez loin de votre souhait d’un désaccord exprimé dans le Respect des Lois et de l’Intégrité des personnes. Vous devriez d’ailleurs rappeler à vos Coreligionnaires si bienveillants et aimants envers les Citoyens qui les accueillent, que la Fête de l’Aïd el-Adha qu’ils vont fêter dans quelques jours est un vibrant Hommage à Abraham, un Juif… même si vous l’appelez Ibrahim ! À mon avis, certains doivent ignorer ce Détail au vu du niveau intellectuel remarquablement bas de leurs Commentaires. Dans votre interview, une phrase m’interpelle tout particulièrement : Dans le même temps, ils doivent accepter et comprendre que dans nos Sociétés le Rapport au sacré n’est pas le même pour tous. J’aimerais savoir de quelle Société vous parlez ?* Est-ce la Société Musulmane ,* Est-ce la Société Française ,* Est-ce la Société Marocaine ?* Est-ce la Société Algérienne ou Tunisienne ? Si c’est la Société Marocaine ou Algérienne, c’est que vous ne vous sentez pas FrançaisSi c’est la Société Musulmane ou Algérienne, c’est que vous ne vous sentez pas Démocrateet si c’est la Société Française , je vous rappelle qu’elle n’a aucun Rapport au Sacré puisque séparée du Religieux, depuis qu’une célèbre Loi de 1905 en a décidé ainsi, ce que manifestement, malgré votre Récente Naturalisation, vous ne semblez pas avoir encore bien intégré. D’ailleurs, dans votre Document répertoriant les différents Abattoirs pour l’Aïd, vous illustrez parfaitement la difficulté que vous et vos Coreligionnaires avez à vous considérer comme des Citoyens Français à part entière puisque vous adressez vos voeux aux Musulmans de France et non pas aux Français Musulmans. Je vous invite donc, Vous et vos Coreligionnaires «de France», à vous interroger sur votre Rôle dans notre Société Française, sur votre Capacité à adhérer à nos Valeurs Laïques et Démocratiques, et sur votre Capacité à pratiquer l’Auto-Dérision, car décidément, je vous trouve très coincés du turban et de la babouche. J’attends avec impatience, votre Rapport sur les Actes Islamophobes que vous avez recensés, et ne manquerai pas de compiler de mon côté, les Actes Francophobes que je me ferai un plaisir de vous transmettre à mon tour. Par ailleurs, en cherchant (vainement) vos Coordonnées, je tombe à l’instant sur un Article du site c.f.c.m.t.v, particulièrement insultant pour les Citoyens Français. Je suis très choquée par les Relents de Xénophobie teintée de racisme, de cet Article dans lequel il est question de la France qualifiée de République malade et satanisée, de «protection bienveillante d’un Pouvoir Occulte, qui trouve toute sa Jouissance dans le Spectacle du malheur d’une Frange indésirée de sa Population, de la France victime de son arrogance et de son orgueil. En tant que Représentant des Musulmans en France, vous seriez bien inspiré de veiller à ce que le Pays qui vous accueille, et qui vous a accepté comme Citoyen, ne soit pas insulté et traîné dans la boue par votre Communauté, car si la Loi sur le Blasphème n’existe pas, la Loi sur la Diffamation existe bel et bien. Je vous prierai donc de faire en sorte, que cet Article injurieux soit rectifié, afin de ne pas créer davantage de tensions. Veuillez agréer, Monsieur Moussaoui, mes salutations définitivement laïques.",

Some of the quotes attributed to him seem ridiculous, as is the fact that no one ever picked up on this while it was in progress!     President Obama's Chicago homecoming was less welcoming than he expected, as Obama was shocked to learn his Hyde Park residence had been foreclosed upon some time last year. Obama was in Chicago for a series of fundraisers and decided to visit his old home, only to discover the locks had been changed and a new family had moved in.  Since his inauguration, President Obama had neglected to make a single payment on the home he'd shared with his wife and two daughters, while the house itself fell into grave disrepair.  The place started to become a real eyesore, said Kevin Deckman, who owns a home on the opposite side of the street from the former Obama residence. The lawn was nothing but weeds, and there were a bunch of stray cats that would come and go through an open window, I think. It was a real health hazard. I had to tell my kids to stay away from the Obama house so they wouldn't catch rabies.  [Rest of article here.]",

This could be a mere coincidence, but this gets more interesting:  1) New York is the 11th state.  2) The first plane crashing against the Twin Towers was flight number 11.  3) Flight 11 was carrying 92 passengers. 9 + 2 = 11  4) Flight 77 which also hit Twin Towers, was carrying 65 passengers. 6 + 5 = 11  5) The tragedy was on September 11, or 9/11 as it is now known. 9 + 1 + 1 = 11  6) The date is equal to the US emergency services telephone number 911. 9 + 1 + 1 = 11.  Sheer coincidence..?! Read on and make up your own mind:  1) The total number of victims inside all the hi-jacked planes was 254. 2 + 5 + 4 = 11.  2) September 11 is day number 254 of the calendar year. Again 2 + 5 + 4 = 11.  3) The Madrid bombing took place on 3/11/2004. 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 11.  4) The tragedy of Madrid happened 911 days after the Twin Towers incident.  Now this is where things get totally eerie:  The most recognised symbol for the US, after the Stars & Stripes, is the Eagle. The following verse is taken from the Quran, the Islamic holy book:  For it is written that a son of Arabia would awaken a fearsome Eagle. The wrath of the Eagle would be felt throughout the lands of Allah and lo, while some of the people trembled in despair still more rejoiced: for the wrath of the Eagle cleansed the lands of Allah and there was peace.  That verse is number 9.11 of the Quran.  Still uncovinced about all of this..?! Try this and see how you feel afterwards, it made my hair stand on end:  Open Microsoft Word and do the following:  1. Type in capitals Q33 NY. This is the flight number of the first plane to hit one of the Twin Towers.  2. Highlight the Q33 NY.  3. Change the font size to 48.  4. Change the actual font to the WINGDINGS  What do you think now?!!",

Thirteen other people were injured after a twenty-car pile up resulted from people trying to avoid hitting the woman who was apparently convinced  that the rapture was occurring when she saw twelve people floating up into the air, and then passed a man on the side of the road who she claimed was Jesus.  She started screaming He's back, He's back and climbed right out of the sunroof and jumped off the roof of the car, said Everett Williams, husband of 28-year-old Georgann Williams who was pronounced dead at the scene. I was slowing down but she wouldn't wait till I stopped, Williams said.  She thought the rapture was happening and was convinced that Jesus was gonna lift her up into the sky, he went on to say. This is the strangest thing I've seen since I've been on the force, said Paul Madison, first officer on the scene. Madison questioned the man who looked like Jesus and discovered that he was dressed up as Jesus and was on his way to a toga costume party when the tarp covering the bed of his pickup truck came loose and released twelve blow up sex dolls filled with helium which floated up into the air.  Ernie Jenkins, 32, of Fort Smith, who's been told by several of his friends that he looks like Jesus, pulled over and lifted his arms into the air in frustration, and said , Come back here, just as the Williams' car passed him, and Mrs. Williams was sure that it was Jesus lifting people up into the sky as they passed by him, according to her husband, who says his wife loved Jesus more than anything else.  When asked for comments about the twelve sex dolls, Jenkins replied This is all just too weird for me. I never expected anything like this to happen.",

        "tweet": "ATTENTION ALL CHRISTIANS - Be careful where you eat.  This is an incident that just recently happened right here in Albany, Georgia, a few weeks ago:  A local church youth group was returning from a church outing & decided to stop in at the Steak 'n' Shake in Albany, Georgia to eat. There were a dozen or more teenagers around the age of 16 year of age and a few adults. The teenagers were sitting together, in one area of the restaurant. The parents were at a different table giving the teenagers some privacy.  Everyone ordered & received their food. One of the teenager's stood up & told the group to be quiet for the blessing of the food. The teenager said the blessing out loud over their food. Several of the other customers bowed their heads.  After the grace (prayer) was over, the Steak 'n' Shake Manager came over to the young guy & started lecturing the teenager on Steak & Shake's policy, informed him that the practice of public prayer was illegal. She told him that he was not allowed to pray out loud in Steak & Shake Restaurants, and that if he did it again they would be asked to leave. She was shaking her finger in his face, criticizing & ridiculing him for praying out loud in the Steak 'n' Shake Restaurant. This was mainly a group of teenagers who didn't realize the ramifications of this action. One of the adults did stepped up to the manager & told her (the manager) that she didn't need to be attacking the teenager.  One of the adult who was there (who I would trust more than any of the teenagers) said that some of the waitresses came over after the incident and told the teenager that they supported him and gave him the name of the manager who just did this and a number to call and complain. This was done behind the back of the manager who laid down the law, which is understandable since it is company policy, they could be fired for breaking the rules. The teenage youth doesn't want to get anybody in trouble, and won't provide the name of the offending party.  Later, after hearing of this incident, one of the youth group's parent or grandparent called the Albany Steak 'n' Shake Restaurant and asked to speak to the manager. She asked the person who answered the phone about the incident, and they told her the General Manager was coming in the next day and she should call back then and talk to them.  She called back the next day, told the story of the incident, and was told by the General Manager that it is indeed the policy of Steak 'n' Shake Restaurants. That you may pray, but praying out loud could disturb or offend the other customers and you may be asked to leave. Steak 'n' Shake has a no vocal prayer policy. If you break that rule, you may be asked to leave.  The teenager who prayed was not asked to leave, in fact, nobody left when the manager did this, and I believe they should have gotten up, left the food right there on the tables & without paying walked out.  The teenagers are terrified that this is going to get somebody in trouble and wants no part of any protest.  As a Christian Adult, I feel it is just another attack on Christians. We have lost prayer in our public schools, lost prayer at school games & school functions. They are trying to take God out of the Government buildings, off our money, etc. I sure don't want to lose my right to give thanks over my food to the Lord who provided it to me in public.  Business are supported by our In God We Trust dollars. The customers vote for the businesses they like with their In God We Trust dollars. As a Christian, I will vote to eat at restaurants where I am allowed to pray. I will also vote to eat at restaurants where I can take a Christian group or go with a Christian group to eat & be able to pray out loud. As a Christian, I'm outraged, & wasn't sure what to do. So I took it to the Lord (I prayed) & God answered right away. He told me to tell all the world - I feel that I should tell people, so they could make an informed decision. There are probably other restaurants out there that feel the same way, but if Christians stick together we can at least make them miss our business!  What is this teaching our youth & children? That they can't pray in public places or bless their food?  Please forward this to everyone on your E-mail list.  Christians need to know & be heard, we've been silent long enough.  God Bless You!  PS. I would like to hear any feed back you might have on this incident or if you've encountered a similar incident or experience in any particular restaurant.",

Very well, I guess all of you have been seeing (just as I've been) images from this company. In particular, one set of images called my attencion: the Palestinians celebrating the bombing, out on the streets, eating some cake and making funny faces for the camera. Well, THOSE IMAGES WERE SHOT BACK IN 1991!!! Those are images of Palestinians celebrating the invasion of Kuwait! It's simply unacceptable that a super-power of cumminications as CNN uses images which do not correspond to the reality in talking about so serious an issue. A teacher of mine, here in Brazil, has videotapes recorded in 1991, with the very same images he's been sending emails to CNN, Globo (the major TV network in Brazil) and newspapers, denouncing what I myself classify as a crime against the public opinion. If anyone of you has access to this kind of files, serch for it. In the meanwhile, I'll try to 'put my hands' on a copy of this tape.  But now, think for a moment about the impact of such mages. Your people is hurt, emotionally fragile, and this kind broadcast have very high possibility of causing waves of anger and rage against Palestinians. It's simply irresponsible to show images such as those. Finally, I'd like to say that we all regret and condemn all that has happened in the last days but Nikos has a point here. I really don't want to be misunderstood here, but the truth is that US government had shown no respect for other countries in the last decades. In the 60s and 70s they had halped lots of military coups throughout the world (including Brazil in 64). Later, with Reagan and Bush Father, the Washington Consensus have been demolishing the bases of our economies, making us more and more dependant (and, many of us, prehocupied with this situation).  Your current president quickly made things worse: Kioto Protocol, Star Wars, Colombia Plan, the exchange of rain forest for pieces of external debt, tha abandonment of the position of third party in negotiations between IRA and England, and between Palestinians and Israel. All those mistakes in US external politics made your country more hatred than before, and, of course, more vulnerable.",

Parmi eux des centaines de femmes et d’enfants Yazidi qui avaient été pris en otages par le brutal régime islamiste ISIS ont été relâchées cette semaine après plus de huit mois de captivité. Mais les bénévoles travaillant dans ces camps transitoires de fortune pour réfugiés ont déjà dénombré un nombre impressionnant de personnes traumatisées à vie par le groupe djihadiste qui mène une guerre sanglante dans la région. Les travailleurs humanitaires décrivent le cas d’une fillette de neuf ans, enceinte après avoir été violée par 10 hommes différents, qui risquait de mourir pendant son accouchement en raison de son jeune âge et de son état de faiblesse général. « Même une césarienne pourrait lui être fatale » a prédit le travailleur humanitaire canadien Daoud. « Les abus qu’elle a subis l’ont physiquement et mentalement traumatisée à vie » Les combattants de Daesh ont décidé de libérer 200 femmes et fillettes qui avaient été prises en otages l’été dernier lors d’intenses combats au nord de l’Irak. Des dizaines de milliers de Yézidis, une ethnie minoritaire habitant principalement dans le Kurdistan, avaient été attaqués en août 2014. Des centaines avaient été tués durant les combats mais on estime qu’il reste toujours à ce jours près de 4000 filles détenues par les militants djihadistes. Les travailleurs humanitaires expliquent que si ces 200 filles ont été libérées, ceci est dans le but bien précis de leur faire ressentir honte et disgrâce auprès de leurs familles respectives. « Si ces femmes étaient mariées avant d’avoir été capturées, il est évident que leurs maris ne les reprendront jamais et n’accepteront jamais leurs bébés non plus » Traduction FDS du Daily Express et du International Business Times ",

Marketing giant Whole Foods has swallowed islam's numbers campaign hook, line, and sinker. Whole Foods not only supports the Hamas terror training schools, it removes Israeli products and replaces them with those approved by the Arab-muslim occupiers of Israel's historic lands. If you support Israel if you oppose terrorism if you believe in free enterprise  TAKE YOUR BUSINESS ELSEWHERE.  They issue great-sounding PR statements saying one thing a quick look at their actions proves the reverse.  Whole Foods may be hallal for the Arab-muslims who wish to kill Jews, but it is strictly TRAIF for all Jews who wish to survive.  (I know from experience that Trader Joe, which carries similar products, rejected attempts by Arab boycotters to remove Israeli products from their shelves their prices are also MUCH better!)

When it was her turn to be served , and as she reached the cashier, she made a loud remark about the British Flag lapel pin which the female cashier was wearing on her blouse. The cashier reached.... ...............up and touched the pin and said, 'Yes , I always wear it proudly. My son serves abroad with the forces and I wear it for him.  The Muslim woman then asked the cashier when she was going to stop bombing and killing her countrymen explaining that she was Afghani. At that point an elderly gentleman standing in the queue stepped forward and interrupted with a calm, gentle voice, and said to the Afghani woman:  'Excuse me, but hundreds of thousands of British men and women, just like this lady's son, have fought and sacrificed their lives so that people just like YOU can stand here in Britain, which is OUR country and allow you to blatantly accuse an innocent check-out cashier of bombing YOUR countrymen. It is my belief that if you were allowed to be as outspoken as that in Afghan, which you claim to be YOUR country, then we wouldn't need to be fighting there today. However, now that you have learned how to speak out and criticize the British people who have afforded you the protection of OUR country, I will gladly pay the cost of a ticket to help you pay your way back to Afghan. When you get there and if you manage to survive for being as outspoken as what you are here in Britain, then you should be able to help straighten out the mess which YOUR Afghani countrymen have got you into in the first place, which appears to be the reason that you have come to OUR country to avoid'.  Apparently, the queue cheered and applauded.  IF YOU AGREE.... Pass this on to all of your proud British and other worldly friends.... I just did !!!! It's nice to be important, but it's more important to be nice. It's also nice to be British!",

The health threats listed above have all been linked with Gardasil, the so-called cervical cancer vaccine. And thanks to Pharma giant Merck, desperate parents and naive young women believe this vaccine saves lives… they couldn't be more wrong.

And please forward it to anyone you think would benefit from the vital information it contains.

Ali Zaoui, ancien militaire, expert en questions sécuritaires et lutte antiterroriste, ne croit pas à la version donnée par les autorités françaises sur l’enlèvement du touriste français en Algérie. Il a indiqué que le rapt du ressortissant français Pierre-Hervé Gourdel à Bouira est monté de toute pièce par les services secrets français afin d’entraîner l’Algérie dans la lutte contre Daech.Le Temps d’Algérie — Quelle analyse faites-vous du rapt du ressortissant français Pierre-Hervé Gourdel à Bouira ? Ali Zaoui — Pour moi, cet enlèvement est monté de toute pièce par les services secrets français. La France veut forcer l’Algérie à s’ingérer militairement dans la région, et notamment en Libye. C’est le même scénario que Pierre Camatt. On se souvient encore de son affaire. Les Français veulent resserrer l’étau sur l’Algérie et lui forcer la main pour entrer dans ces conflits, surtout après la création de la coalition pour lutter contre l’État Islamique (EI), et la participation de 10 pays arabes, comme déclaré par le président américain, Barack Obama. L’Algérie est une puissance régionale à ne pas négliger. La France ainsi que d’autres pays ont besoin de cette force pour les aider à combattre le terrorisme qu’ils ont eux-mêmes soutenu et financé. Alors que l’un des principes indéfectibles du pays est celui de ne jamais s’ingérer dans les affaires internes des autres pays et encore moins de sortir son armée hors de ses frontières. Pourquoi pensez-vous que ce rapt est un scénario monté par les parties citées ? Disposez-vous de preuves ?  Tous les indices indiquent que ce rapt, combien même revendiqué par le groupuscule Djound al khilafa a été déjà planifié. Comment se fait-il que Pierre-Hervé Gourdel soit enlevé le lendemain de son arrivée en Algérie ? Pourquoi ne s’est-il pas conformé aux consignes de sécurité ? Le ressortissant français faisait de la randonnée dans cette région, connue pour son insécurité. Pourquoi a-t-il donc choisi cet endroit ? Le kidnappé avait loué un chalet au nom de son ami algérien afin d’éviter d’être identifié par les services de sécurité algériens. Et puis, dans son dernier tweet, on pouvait lire : « Quand je rentrerai d’Algérie après le 1er octobre, si je rentre ». Cela indique qu’il était certainement destiné à mener une mission précise en Algérie. Les deux premiers ressortissants français enlevés en Algérie ont déjà été identifiés comme étant des agents d’espionnage français. Pour moi, il n’y a pas de doute : Gourdel est un agent français bien rusé. Mais le groupe dit Djound al khilafa a revendiqué ce rapt… Le groupe terroriste actif dans cette région, baptisé Djound al khilafa, qui a porté allégeance il y a quelques jours à l’organisation terroriste Daech, est composé de 12 membres. Il serait vrai qu’ils ont pu enlever ce ressortissant français. Le chef de ce groupe, de son vrai nom Djamel Aissaoui (Abou Djahada), a cherché par cet acte un nouveau coup médiatique. Mais je pense que cet enlèvement est de la pure propagande médiatique dans la région et au niveau international. Les médias servent de trait d’union entre Djound al khilafa et Daech.  En réalité, ce groupe terroriste n’a pas de contact direct avec cette organisation et utilise les médias pour atteindre ce but. Ces dissidences ne sont, dans le fond, qu’une guerre de leadership entre eux. Le but d’une telle annonce est d’attirer le plus grand nombre de jeunes et de les enrôler dans leurs rangs. Mais ce n’est pas sans compter sur la volonté de l’ANP, qui est de combattre sans relâche le terrorisme et son financement. Qu’il s’agisse d’AQMI ou de Djound el khilafa, c’est juste les noms qui changent mais la détermination de l’armée reste la même.  Croyez-vous que les services de sécurité seraient en mesure de le sauver ? L’ANP est capable de défendre et de protéger l’intégrité du territoire, du peuple et des ressortissants étrangers en Algérie. L’opération de ratissage menée hier aboutira. Les services de sécurité ont acquis une expérience en la matière. L’ultimatum de 24 heures fixé par ce groupe terroriste par la voix du kidnappé via la vidéo diffusée hier ne doit pas être une entrave dans les recherches menées par l’ANP.",

Any minority, from anywhere, if it wants to live in Russia, to work and eat in Russia, should speak Russian, and should respect the Russian laws. If they prefer Shari ‘a Law, then we advise them to go to those places where that's the state law. Russia does not need minorities. Minorities need Russia, and we will not grant them special privileges, or try to change our laws to fit their desires, no matter how loud they yell 'discrimination'. We better learn from the suicides of America, England, Holland and France, if we are to survive as a nation. The Russian customs and traditions are not compatible with the lack of culture or the primitive ways of most minorities. When this honourable legislative body thinks of creating new laws, it should have in mind the national interest first, observing that the minorities are not Russians. The politicians in the Duma gave Putin a standing ovation for five minutes! ",

Prime Minister John Howard - Australia Muslims who want to live under Islamic Sharia law were told on Wednesday to get out of Australia , as the government targeted radicals in a bid to head off potential terror attacks. Separately, Howard angered some Australian Muslims on Wednesday by saying he supported spy agencies monitoring the nation's mosques. Quote: 'IMMIGRANTS, NOT AUSTRALIANS, MUST ADAPT. Take It Or Leave It. I am tired of this nation worrying about whether we are offending some individual or their culture. Since the terrorist attacks on Bali , we have experienced a surge in patriotism by the majority of Australians.' 'This culture has been developed over two centuries of struggles, trials and victories by millions of men and women who have sought freedom' 'We speak mainly ENGLISH, not Spanish, Lebanese, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, or any other language. Therefore, if you wish to become part of our society . Learn the language!' 'Most Australians believe in God. This is not some Christian, right wing, political push, but a fact, because Christian men and women, on Christian principles, founded this nation, and this is clearly documented. It is certainly appropriate to display it on the walls of our schools. If God offends you, then I suggest you consider another part of the world as your new home, because God is part of our culture.' 'We will accept your beliefs, and will not question why. All we ask is that you accept ours, and live in harmony and peaceful enjoyment with us.' 'This is OUR COUNTRY, OUR LAND, and OUR LIFESTYLE, and we will allow you every opportunity to enjoy all this. But once you are done complaining, whining, and griping about Our Flag, Our Pledge, Our Christian beliefs, or Our Way of Life, I highly encourage you take advantage of one other great Australian freedom, 'THE RIGHT TO LEAVE'.' 'If you aren't happy here then LEAVE. We didn't force you to come here. You asked to be here. So accept the country YOU accepted.' Maybe if we circulate this amongst ourselves, American and Canadian citizens will find the backbone to start speaking and voicing the same truths. If you agree ... please SEND THIS ON.",

Washington, DC — June 11, 2009  Congress today announced, that the office of President of the United States of America will be outsourced to India, as of September 1, 2009.  The move is being made in order to save the President's $500,000 yearly salary, and also a record $750 billion in deficit expenditures and related overhead that his office has incurred during the last 3 months.  It is anticipated that $7 trillion can be saved to the end of the President's term. We believe this is a wise financial move. The cost savings are huge, stated Congressman Thomas Reynolds (R-WA). We cannot remain competitive on the world stage with the current level of cash outlay, Reynolds noted.  Obama was informed by email this morning of his termination. Preparations for the job move have been underway for some time.  Gurvinder Singh, a tele-technician for IndusTeleservices, Mumbai, India, will assume the office of President as of September 1, 2009. Mr. Singh was born in the United States while his Indian parents were vacationing at Niagara Falls, NY. Thus making him eligible for the position. He will receive a salary of $320 (USD) a month, but no health coverage or other benefits.  It is believed that Mr. Singh will be able to handle his job responsibilities without a support staff. Due to the time difference between the US and India, he will be working primarily at night. Working nights will allow me to keep my day job at the Dell Computer call center, stated Mr. Singh in an exclusive interview.  I am excited about this position. I always hoped I would be President. A Congressional spokesperson noted that while Mr. Singh may not be fully aware of all the issues involved in the office of President, this should not be a problem as Obama had never been familiar with the issues either. Mr. Singh will rely upon a script tree that will enable him to respond effectively to most topics of concern. Using these canned responses, he can address common concerns without having to understand the underlying issue at all. We know these scripting tools work, stated the spokesperson. Obama has used them successfully for years, with the result that some people actually thought he knew what he was talking about.  Obama will receive health coverage, expenses, and salary until his final day of employment. Following a two-week waiting period, he will be eligible for $140 a week unemployment for 26 weeks. Unfortunately he will not be eligible for Medicaid, as his unemployment benefits will exceed the allowed limit.  Obama has been provided with the outplacement services of Manpower, Inc. to help him write a resume and prepare for his upcoming job transition. According to Manpower, Obama may have difficulties in securing a new position due to a lack of any successful work experience during his lifetime.  A greeter position at WalMart was suggested due to Obama's extensive experience at shaking hands, as well as his 'special' smile.",

Hello, my name is Tina Strongman and I work at a police station, as a phone operator for 911. Lately, we've received many phone calls pertaining to a new sort of problem that has arisen in the inner cities, and is now working it's way to smaller towns. It seems that a new form of gang initiation is to go find as many pay phones as possible and put a mixture of LSD and Strychnine onto the buttons. This mixture is deadly to the human touch, and apparently, this has killed some people on the east coast. Strychnine is a chemical used in rat poison and is easily separated from the rest of the chemicals. When mixed with LSD, it creates a substance that is easily absorbed into the human flesh, and highly fatal.  Please be careful if you are using a pay phone anywhere. You may want to wipe it off, or just not use one at all.  Please be very careful.  Let your friends and family know about this potential hazard.  Thank you.",

Mullins is HUGE and is owned by 11 brothers and sisters in the Mullins family. My friend Jeanne is the CEO.  The facility is mammoth. We toured about 280,000 square feet! Questions about food poisoning came up and I wanted to share what I learned from a chemist.  The guy who gave us our tour is named Ed. He's one of the brothers. Ed is a chemistry expert and is involved in developing most of the sauce formula. He's even developed sauce formula for McDonald's.  Keep in mind that Ed is a food chemistry whiz. During the tour, someone asked if we really needed to worry about mayonnaise. People are always worried that mayonnaise will spoil. Ed's answer will surprise you. Ed said that all commercially-made Mayo is completely safe. It doesn't even have to be refrigerated. No harm in refrigerating it, but it's not really necessary. He explained that the pH in mayonnaise is set at a point that bacteria could not survive in that environment. He then talked about the quint essential picnic, with the bowl of potato salad sitting on the table and how everyone blames the mayonnaise when someone gets sick.  Ed says that when food poisoning is reported, the first thing the officials look for is when the 'victim' last ate ONIONS and where those onions came from (in the potato salad?). Ed says it's not the mayonnaise (as long as it's not homemade Mayo) that spoils in the outdoors. It's probably the onions, and if not the onions, it's the POTATOES. He explained, onions are a huge magnet for bacteria, especially uncooked onions. You should never plan to keep a portion of a sliced onion. He says it's not even safe if you put it in a zip-lock bag and put it in your refrigerator. It's already contaminated enough just by being cut open and out for a bit, that it can be a danger to you (and doubly watch out for those onions you put in your hotdogs at the baseball park!)  Ed says if you take the leftover onion and cook it like crazy you'll probably be okay, but if you slice that leftover onion and put on your sandwich, you're asking for trouble. Both the onions and the moist potato in a potato salad, will attract and grow bacteria faster than any commercial mayonnaise will even begin to break down.  So, how's that for news? Take it for what you will. I (the author) am going to be very careful about my onions from now on. For some reason, I see a lot of credibility coming from a chemist and a company, that produces millions of pounds of mayonnaise every year.'  Also, dogs should NEVER eat onions. Their stomachs cannot metabolize onions. ",

Pas de musique de fond afin de ne pas troubler votre lecture Le leg culturel au niveau mondial dont vos enfants heriteront sera extremement different de ce qu'il est aujourd'hui Vous allez assister à un etat des lieux sur les changements demographiques de la planete Selon des etudes pour qu'une culture perdure plus de 25 ans, il doit y avoir un taux de fertilité obligatoire de 2,11 enfants par famille.Si ce taux est inferieur, la culture decline Historiquement aucune culture n'a jamais inversé ce processus d'un taux de fertilité de 1,9 .A un taux de 1,3 il est impossible d'inverser ce processus parce que ça prendrait de 80 à 100 ans pour etre corrigé et qu'il n'y a aucun modele economique pour soutenir une culture durant cette periode En d'autres termes, si 2 couples de parents ont chacun 1 enfant, il y aura moitié moins d'enfants que de parents et si chacun de ces enfants a 1 enfant, il y aura un seul petit enfant pour 4 grands parents si seulement 1 millions de bébés sont nés en 2009, il sera difficile d'avoir 2 millions d'adultes à l'horizon 2026 Quand une population decline, la culture le fait egalement .... en 2007, le taux de fertilité: en france etait de 1,8 en angleterre 1,6  en grece 1,3  en allemagne 1,3  en italie 1,2  en espagne 1,1 Dans une union europeenne se composant de 31 pays,  le taux de fertilité est un petit 1,38 Des etudes historiques nous disent que ce nombre est impossible à corriger Dans quelques années , l'Europe telle que nous la connaissons aura cessé d'exister Pourtant, jusqu'à present la population de l'Europe ne diminue pas Pourquoi ? A cause de l'immigration musulmane... Parmi toutes les augmentations de population en Europe depuis 1990, 90/100 l'ont été du fait d'une immigration musulmane. En France, Francais d'origine, 1,8 enfants par famille, Musulmans 8,1 par famille !! Dans le sud de la France, traditionnellement une des zones du monde ou il y avait le plus d’Églises, il y a actuellement plus de mosquées que d’Églises. Dans les plus grandes villes comme Nice, Marseille et Paris, ce nombre atteint 45/100 En 2027, 1 français sur 5 sera musulman Dans juste 39ans,  la France sera une République islamique... Ces 30 dernières années, la population musulmane de grande Bretagne est passée de 82000 à 2,1 millions... Une multiplication par 30 Au Pays Bas 50/100 des nouveaux nés sont musulmans et dans seulement 15 ans, la moitié de la population des Pays Bas sera musulmane En Russie, il y a plus de 23 millions de musulmans, soit 1 russe sur 5 ...  40/100 de l'armée russe sera musulmane dans seulement quelques années . Actuellement en Belgique, 25/100 de la population et 5/100 de tous les nouveaux nés sont musulmans Le gouvernement belge a déclaré qu'un tiers de tous les enfants nés en Europe en 2025 naitront dans une famille musulmane Le gouvernement allemand, le premier à en avoir parlé ouvertement a recemment declaré :  le declin de la population allemande ne peut plus etre arreté.Cette spirale regressive ne peut plus etre inversée... L'Allemagne sera un etat islamique aux alentours de l'année 2050 Kadhafi, le leader libyen a dit : il y a des signes qu'Allah va accorder une immense victoire à l'Islam en Europe, sans épées, sans fusils, sans conquête . Nous n'avons pas besoin de terroristes, nous n'avons pas besoin de kamikazes ... Les quelques 50 millions de musulmans qui vivent en Europe en feront un continent musulman dans seulement quelques dizaines d'années ... Il y a actuellement 52 millions de musulmans en Europe Le gouvernement allemand a dit qu'il faut s'attendre à ce que le nombre double dans les 20 prochaines années, soit 104 millions ... Sur le continent américain, les chiffres nous racontent la même histoire. Actuellement le taux de fertilité au Canada est de 1,6. A près de 0,5 point en dessous de ce qu'il faut à une culture pour se maintenir. L'Islam est maintenant la religion la plus rapide à se développer. En 2001 et 2006, la population du Canada a augmenté de 1,6 millions dont 1,2 millions venant de l'immigration. Aux États-Unis, le taux de fertilité du citoyen américain est de 1,6. Avec l'afflux de l'immigration venant des pays latino américains le taux grimpe à 2,11 , le minimum requis pour maintenir une culture existante. En 1970, il y avait 100 000 musulmans aux États-Unis, ils sont aujourd'hui plus de 9 millions ... Le monde est en train de changer il est temps de se réveiller... Il y a 4 ans, une conférence de 24 organisation musulmanes a eu lieu à Chicago. Les transcriptions de cette conférence montrent en détail que ces organisations prévoient d’évangéliser les États-Unis au moyen des médias, de la politique,de l’éducation... etc Ils ont dit :  Nous devons nous préparer au fait que dans 30 ans il y aura 50 millions de musulmans qui vivront aux États-Unis   . Le monde dans lequel nous vivons ne sera pas le monde dans lequel vos enfants et petits enfants vivront, L’Église catholique a récemment déclaré que l'Islam vient juste de la dépasser en nombre de croyants ... Des statistiques montrent qu'au vu du taux d'accroissement de l'Islam, elle sera la religion dominante du monde dans 5 à 7 ans ... Pourquoi ne pas donner enfin la parole aux natalistes, à ceux qui pensent que toute civilisation qui ne fait plus d'enfants se condamne à la servitude d'abord, à la mort ensuite. J'ajoute que l'immigration sera beaucoup mieux vécue par tout le monde quand les européens cesseront d'avoir l'impression d’être submergés : Pour cela ils suffit que les maternelles s'emplissent à nouveau de petits Hans, de petits Peter,de petit Giovanni et autres Marcel, Paul, Julien...! Car si La France est dans une situation démographique assez bonne, l'Allemagne et l'Italie ont déjà un pied dans la tombe !!!! Cette présentation a été réalisée avec des infos issues des meilleurs sites dédies. Tout est vérifiable. Que certains n'aillent pas chercher une connotation raciste dans ces écrits, ce n’était pas l'intention ni le but recherchés. seule l’information prime.

Here's why:  A California lawsuit which is now headed to the U.S. Supreme Court would make the use of the words natural family, marriage and union of a man and a woman a hate speech crime in government workplaces. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has already ruled in favor of the plaintiffs. CNN and The Washington Post both reported that General Peter Pace, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of staff, was fired because of his publicly expressed moral opposition to homosexual behavior. A bill now before Congress (H.R. 1592 / S. 1105) would criminalize negative comments concerning homosexuality, such as calling the practice of homosexuality a sin from the pulpit, a hate crime punishable by a hefty fine and time in prison. This dangerous legislation would take away our freedom of speech and our freedom of religion.",

Fourteen days ago President Obama issued an Executive Order that you should know about. This order gives an unprecedented level of authority to the President and the federal government to take over all the fundamental parts of our economy - in the name of national security - in times of national emergency. This means all of our water resources, construction services and materials (steel, concrete, etc.), our civil transportation system, food and health resources, our energy supplies including oil and natural gas - even farm equipment - can be taken over by the President and his cabinet secretaries. The Government can also draft U.S. citizens into the military and force U.S. citizens to fulfill labor requirements for the purposes of national defense. There is not even any Congressional oversight, only briefings are required.  By issuing this as an Executive Order the President puts the federal government above the law, which, in a democracy, is never supposed to happen.  As President and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, he has the Constitutional authority to issue executive orders. And while similar orders have been made before by presidents from Eisenhower and Reagan to Clinton and George Bush - it has never been done to this extent.  It is still unclear why this order was signed now, and what the consequences are for our nation - especially during times of peace. This type of Martial Law imposes a government takeover on U.S. citizens that is typically reserved for national emergencies, not in a time of relative peace.",

Outrées et inquiètes, deux mamans se sont alarmées de ce que leurs enfants d’une même classe devaient apprendre les rudiments d’une idéologie totalitaire qui se rend de plus en plus imposante, de plus en plus visible et de plus en plus dangereuse dans le monde entier. L’une des deux mamans a fait part à l’équipe enseignante de sa désapprobation. Lors du cours suivant, les élèves ont été soumis à un contrôle sur les éléments constituant une mosquée. La seconde mère d’élève a à son tour protesté sur les cours donnés et mis un mot dans le carnet de correspondance dont l’usage est précisément réservé à cet effet. On se serait alors attendu à un échange civilisé de petits mots, comme le veut l’usage, entre un parent et l’enseignant de son enfant, que chacun expose ses arguments et son point de vue en adultes responsables, organise un rendez-vous pour dialoguer et résoudre le problème. Mais la maîtresse ne l’a semble-t-il pas entendu de cette oreille et, en guise de vengeance, de rétorsion pour l’exemple au cas où d’autres auraient eu l’envie de l’éclairer sur les « bienfaits » du sacro-saint dogme, a préféré très courageusement s’en prendre à l’élève qu’elle a envoyé dans le bureau de la directrice. Suite à cela la maman protestataire a elle-même été convoquée pour subir une mesure disciplinaire et être réprimandée comme on l’aurait fait d’une élève insolente et désobéissante. La directrice les a fort aimablement encouragés elle et son fils à quitter l’école si elle n’était pas contente, et si elle persistait à refuser qu’on distille les préceptes coraniques dans les veines et le cerveau de son enfant. Le fascisme islamique n’a même plus besoin des musulmans pour propager son virus, le corps enseignant fait preuve d’un zèle ostensible et remarquable pour contaminer des centaines de milliers d’enfants par une gigantesque PMA (Propagande Musulmane Accélérée). Voilà. Nos enfants sont utilisés, endoctrinés par le système scolaire, qu’il soit public ou privé. Et les parents qui entendent garder un droit de regard légitime sur « l’enseignement » dispensé à leur enfant sont contraints au silence, par la menace à la répudiation pendant que l’enfant, lui, est puni en raison d’un désaccord entre adultes censés donner l’exemple. C’est très grave. Nos enfants sont jetés au plus tôt dans les rouages d’une machine monstrueuse destinée à leur broyer le cerveau, à leur inculquer des choses qui ne relèvent certainement pas de l’instruction mais du plus pur prosélytisme. Et gare à qui ose contester le système. La dictature est à nos portes avec les petits soldats rouges de l’Education Nationale et de l’enseignement privé au garde à vous, prêts à éliminer la tête qui dépasse, à l’envoyer dans la chambre 101 pour la rééduquer.Il y a non assistance à personne en danger. Cette école de St Mihiel ne déroge donc pas à la règle, sa directrice et son équipe, en parfaits petits soldats du système obligent des petits à ingurgiter des versets coraniques, à se familiariser à une idéologie qui n’a rien à envier au nazisme. Et chacun se tait, se soumet, regarde ailleurs, tandis que dans ce coin de France on écrase dans un étau de silence et de chantage des mamans et leur enfant.",

        "tweet": "GAS WAR - an idea that WILL work  This was originally sent by a retired Coca Cola executive. It came from one of his engineer buddies who retired from Halliburton. It 's worth your consideration.  Join the resistance!!!! I hear we are going to hit close to $4.00 a gallon by next summer and it might go higher!! Want gasoline prices to come down? We need to take some intelligent, united action. Phillip Hollsworth offered this good idea.  This makes MUCH MORE SENSE than the don't buy gas on a certain day campaign that was going around last April or May! The oil companies just laughed at that because they knew we wouldn't continue to hurt ourselves by refusing to buy gas. It was more of an inconvenience to us than it was a problem for them.  BUT, whoever thought of this idea, has come up with a plan that can really work. Please read on and join with us! By now you're probably thinking gasoline priced at about $1.50 is super cheap. Me too! It is currently $2.79 for regular unleaded in my town. Now that the oil companies and the OPEC nations have conditioned us to think that the cost of a gallon of gas is CHEAP at $1.50 - $1.75, we need to take aggressive action to teach them that BUYERS control the marketplace..... not sellers. With the price of gasoline going up more each day, we consumers need to take action. The only way we are going to see the price of gas come down is if we hit someone in the pocketbook by not purchasing their gas! And, we can do that WITHOUT hurting ourselves. How? Since we all rely on our cars, we can't just stop buying gas. But we CAN have an impact on gas prices if we all act together to force a price war.  Here's the idea:  For the rest of this year, DON'T purchase ANY gasoline from the two biggest companies (which now are one), EXXON and MOBIL. If they are not selling any gas, they will be inclined to reduce their prices. If they reduce their prices, the other companies will have to follow suit.  But to have an impact, we need to reach literally millions of Exxon and Mobil gas buyers. It's really simple to do! Now, don't wimp out at this point.... keep reading and I'll explain how simple it is to reach millions of people.  I am sending this note to 30 people. If each of us sends it to at least ten more (30 x 10 =3D 300) ... and those 300 send it to at least ten more (300 x 10 =3D 3,000)...and so on, by the time the message reaches the sixth group of people, we will have reached over THREE MILLION consumers. If those three million get excited and pass this on to ten friends each, then 30 million people will have been contacted! If it goes one level further, you guessed it..... THREE HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE!!!  Again, all you have to do is send this to 10 people. That's all. (If you don't understand how we can reach 300 million and all you have to do is send this to 10 people.... Well, let's face it, you just aren't a mathematician. But I am, so trust me on this one.)  How long would all that take? If each of us sends this e-mail out to ten more people within one day of receipt, all 300 MILLION people could conceivably be contacted within the next 8 days!!! I'll bet you didn't think you and I had that much potential, did you?  Acting together we can make a difference. If this makes sense to you, please pass this message on. I suggest that we not buy from EXXON/MOBIL UNTIL THEY LOWER THEIR PRICES TO THE $1.30 RANGE AND KEEP THEM DOWN.  THIS CAN REALLY WORK.",

        "tweet": "******SAFETY NOTICE****** One of the traditional services provided to the motoring public by Police Agencies and tow truck operators involves assisting those operators who unwittingly lock their keys inside their vehicles.  Several types of devices are on the market which allow an officer, or tow truck operator, to unlock the vehicle by sliding a metal rod, commonly known as a slim jim, between the door window and frame in order to access the control rods which unlock the door lock and handle. Once unlocked, the owner can enter the vehicle and retrieve the keys. Many devices have successfully been used for this purpose, including the well known coat hanger.  On Wednesday, December 3rd, the following Officer Safety notice was received at our Clifton Park, NY D&H District office via the New York Statewide Police Information Network. *****MOTOR VEHICLE ALERT**********CAUTION***** While attempting to gain entry to a vehicle with side impact airbags in a lockout, at least three Law Enforcement Officials have been killed using a Slim Jim Device. Inadvertent deployment of the airbag can cause the slim jim to be launched upward with great force. The force is strong enough to cause the device to penetrate the chin of the person attempting to access the vehicle, after which it can continue on to become lodged in the brain.  Even when lockout assistance efforts do not prove to be deadly, the damage costs can be significant and may include thousands of dollars for replacement of the dashboard, which is designed to breakaway so as not to harm the driver or front passenger. The wiring for many of these side impact airbags is not shielded in any way, so a car opening tool can easily damage the wiring, causing malfunction or possible deployment of the airbag.  Employees who find themselves in a situation where they need to get into a locked vehicle should be aware of the possible danger of deployment of the airbags for their own safety as well as the safety of others.",

This could represent a serious threat as bogus drivers(terrorists) can drop off anything to anyone with deadly consequences! If you have ANY questions when a UPS driver appears at your door they should be able to furnish VALID I.D. Additionally, if someone in a UPS uniform comes to make a drop off or pick up, make absolutely sure they are driving a UPS truck. UPS doesn't make deliveries or pickups in anything, except a company vehicle. If you have a problem, call your local law enforcement agency right away! TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY! Tell everyone in your office, your family, your friends, etc. Make people aware so that we can prepare and/or avoid terrorist attacks on our people!

SO FOR A FEW MORE CENTS I BOUGHT THE LIBERTY GOLD BRAND OR THE DOLE SINCE IT'S FROM CALIF.  TAKES FOREVER JUST TO BUY FOOD AND DO LABEL READING ! !  Are we Americans as dumb as we appear — or — is it that we just do not think? While the Chinese, knowingly and intentionally, export inferior and even toxic products and dangerous toys and goods to be sold in American markets, the media wrings its hands and criticizes the ex-Bush Administration for perceived errors.  Yet 70% of Americans believe that the trading privileges afforded to the Chinese should be suspended.  Well, duh..why do you need the government to suspend trading privileges?  SIMPLY DO IT YOURSELF, AMERICA!!  Simply look on the bottom of every product you buy, and if it says 'Made in China' or 'PRC' (and that now includes Hong Kong), simply choose another product, or none at all. You will be amazed at how dependent you are on Chinese products, and you will be equally amazed at what you can do without.  Who needs plastic eggs to celebrate Easter? If you must have eggs, use real ones and benefit some American farmer. Easter is just an example, the point is do not wait for the government to act. Just go ahead and assume control on your own.  THINK ABOUT THIS: If 200 million Americans refuse to buy just $20 each of Chinese goods, that's a billion dollar trade imbalance resolved in our favor...fast!!  The downside? Some American businesses will feel a temporary pinch from having foreign stockpiles of inventory. Wahhhhhhhhhhhh !!!  The solution? Let's give them fair warning and send our own message. Most of the people who have been reading about this matter are planning on implementing this on June 4, and continue it until July 4. That is only one month of trading losses, but it will hit the Chinese for 1/12th of the total, or 8%, of their American exports. Then they will at least have to ask themselves if the benefits of their arrogance and lawlessness were worth it.  Remember, June 4 to July 4.  EVEN BETTER. . . START NOW.  Send this to everybody you know. Let's show them that we are Americans and NOBODY can take us for granted.  If we can't live without cheap Chinese goods for one month out of our lives, WE DESERVE WHAT WE GET!  Pass it on, America !   ",

        "tweet": "Monday, October 4th 2004 ended a six-year dispute involving Sophia Stewart, the Wachowski Brothers, Joel Silver and Warner Brothers. Stewart's allegations, involving copyright infringement and racketeering, were received and acknowledged by the Central District of California, Judge Margaret Morrow residing.  Stewart, a New Yorker who has resided in Salt Lake City for the past five years, will recover damages from the films, The Matrix I, II and III, as well as The Terminator and its sequels. She will soon receive one of the biggest payoffs in the history of Hollywood, as the gross receipts of both films and their sequels total over 2.5 billion dollars.  Stewart filed her case in 1999, after viewing the Matrix, which she felt had been based on her manuscript, The Third Eye, copyrighted in 1981. In the mid-eighties Stewart had submitted her manuscript to an ad placed by the Wachowski Brothers, requesting new sci-fi works.  According to court documentation, an FBI investigation discovered that more than thirty minutes had been edited from the original film, in an attempt to avoid penalties for copyright infringement. The investigation also stated that 'credible witnesses employed at Warner Brothers came forward, claiming that the executives and lawyers had full knowledge that the work in question did not belong to the Wachowski Brothers.' These witnesses claimed to have seen Stewart's original work and that it had been 'often used during preparation of the motion pictures.' The defendants tried, on several occasions, to have Stewart's case dismissed, without success.  Stewart has confronted skepticism on all sides, much of which comes from Matrix fans, who are strangely loyal to the Wachowski Brothers. One on-line forum, entitled Matrix Explained has an entire section devoted to Stewart. Some who have researched her history and writings are open to her story.  Others are suspicious and mocking. 'It doesn't bother me,' said Stewart in a phone interview last week, 'I always knew what was true.' Some fans, are unaware of the case or they question its legitimacy, due to the fact that it has received little to no media coverage. Though the case was not made public until October of 2003, Stewart has her own explanation, as quoted at aghettotymz.com: 'The reason you have not seen any of this in the media is because Warner Brothers parent company is AOL-Time Warner ... this GIANT owns 95 percent of the media ... let me give you a clue as to what they own in the media business ... New York Times papers/magazines, LA Times papers/magazines, People Magazine, CNN news, Extra, Celebrity Justice, Entertainment Tonight, HBO, New Line Cinema, DreamWorks, Newsweek, Village Roadshow and many, many more! They are not going to report on themselves. They have been suppressing my case for years.'  Fans who have taken Stewart's allegations seriously, have found eerie mythological parallels, which seem significant in a case that revolves around the highly metaphorical and symbolic Matrix series. Sophia, the Greek goddess of wisdom has been referenced many times in speculation about Stewart. In one book about the Goddess Sophia, it reads, 'The black goddess is the mistress of web creation spun in her divine matrix.' Although there have been outside implications as to racial injustice (Stewart is African American), she does not feel that this is the case. 'This is all about the Benjamins,' said Stewart. 'It's not about money with me. It's about justice.' ",

As you probably already know, 2 of Brian's former platoon members, Ron Young & Dave Williams, have been captured by Iraqi troopers when their aircraft landed in the wrong area. Dave Williams' wife, Michelle, lives here in Killeen. The wives of 1/227 went to all of the surrounding stores & restaurants asking if they would give Dave's wife & children gift certificates for food or merchandise. Every place they went, gave over & beyond what was asked. McDonald's gave $150 in food certificates to Dave's family and also stated they would cater all FRG (Family Readiness Group) Meetings and provide child care w/Ronald McDonald. These meetings take place once a month, but what a nice gesture. However, the only restaurant that absolutely refused to give any form of certificate was Red Lobster. They informed that if they did it for his family, they would have to do it for every family that had a crisis. This was an outrage considering this business is only open because Killeen is a military town.  Upon hearing this, one of the wives who's husband also is a pilot with 1/227, was livid. She waited until the next business day at 12:30 PM and marched in Red Lobster and asked if she could speak with the manager. She asked their reason why they refused to donate a certificate for $20, $10 or even $5 for Dave's wife & children to eat and was told the same lousy excuse. That's when she got really loud. Now you have to know, lunch time here in Killeen is very busy and most restaurants are filled with large tables of soldiers eating together. She started telling everyone in the restaurant that Dave was currently a POW and that Red Lobster wouldn't donate even $5 to his family to eat on. Entire tables of 10-15 people, both soldiers & civilians, started to get up and walk out. One LTC stopped and asked her what was going on. When she told him, he looked at the manager and said he wouldn't be back and would tell everyone he knows not to eat there again.  I just wanted to let everyone know that I won't be eating at Red Lobster either. Ron Young, one of the POW, was a very close friend to Brian & me. Madeline called him Ms Ron. I hate to say that I only met Dave & his wife, Michelle, twice and didn't really get to know them. They had only been with the Unit 2 months before Brian left. We are all praying for their safe return & God speed.  It infuriates me to no end to know that a restaurant does not support our troops. Especially when the majority of the people that eat there are soldiers and their families.",

Email advising the blood gang will be driving a silver SUV and must kill 31 women on Halloween night.     Someone took my son to practice yesterday and the police were there handing out flyers. They received a tip that there would be a gang initiation (Bloods) on October 31, 2008 where they are targeting women. The goal is to kill or serious injury between 30 - 50 women. They didn't know what area(s) would be targeted or if it's going to be city or county. Please make sure you are very careful going out on Halloween and be very aware of your surroundings whether you're going trick or treating or just going out. This was reported in Maryland.     Please use extreme caution tonight:  To my understanding a local gang in Rocky Mount 'The Crypt' is out to kill 31 women by midnight tonight. A lady that attends my church works @ Golden East Crossing & mall security is warning all women to PLEASE BE CAREFUL!!!! DO NOT BE OUT ALONE-W/OUT ADULT COMPANIONSHIP. THIS IS SERIOUS. I WOULD HATE FOR ANY OF YOU TO FALL VICTIM TO THESE HEARTLESS GANGS.  Please pass this on to everyone you know!!!!     I received this email today and also know of others who have received text messages about this today:  I just got a call from work stating that Florence Police and Solicitor's Office (Florence, SC) have notified us that the gang 900 Boys of West Florence are planning on shooting 14 white people tonight. Stated that it could be rumor but had spoken with informant that confirmed. They warned that the targets were mainly women. Stated to stay away from conv. stores and to not buy gas after 4:00 PM as they thought they would be drive by shootings. You might have already heard about it, but if not, tell everybody.     I just received a phone call telling me to be very careful, because the person knows that I travel alone. Signs are being posted at WalMart and other stores warning women to be very careful when entering or exited their cars because the gang Bloods for their initiation are ordering new members to kill at least 34 women before the end of Halloween.  I don't know how true this is, but please be careful, you never know, and Halloween is the time when a lot of things happen.     Dear All,  My future son-in-law works in Upper Montclair, N.J. He shared that police officers in Upper Montclair and Essex County are visitng local businesses to share the following information... Gangbangers are planning major initiations on October 30th and 31st, and they will be targeting women. It is recommeded that women stay indoors after sunset on those two nights. Please forward this email to everyone you know.     I received a text message that the Bloods gang are running an initiation october 30th and 31st targeting girls and killing them.     Alert for Tonight (UNCLASSIFIED)  I just got this from a friend who gets Alerts from a detective in her neighborhood, Box Hill North. It's important to pass along....  I have just received some very important intelligence. Tonight October 30 and tomorrow October 31st, 2008 are supposed to be Blood Gang Initiation Nights. On these nights, new gang members are to be initiated and as part of their initiation they are supposed to carry out some random acts of violence. As of this minute, I am being told that women are being targeted and they are to kill/injury at least 30-35 women. In the law enforcement community we don't take these warnings lightly. Specific areas are not known at this time, but as you all are aware, Blood Gang sets are all over in the State of Maryland at this time. Please all women, pay attention to your surroundings and if you take your kids out trick or treating for Halloween. Please don't travel by yourself. I know some women can handle themselves, but if you can please take a male partner or two with you.  Strength are in numbers! If you see or recognize any gang members in your area, please contact your local police office immediately. The colors or flags of the Blood Gang are any combination of the colors Black, Red, and White. They usually accessorize this with a red bandana. Also, in an effort to educate the masses, please forward this email on to as many people in our area as possible.",

I thought it was worth sharing with the world, and hope you will forward it to all your friends. It clearly shows just how far this country has gone in the wrong direction.     It has always been the custom at Roane County High School football games to say a prayer and play the National Anthem to honor God and Country.  Due to a recent ruling by the Supreme Court, I am told that saying a prayer is a violation of Federal Case Law.  As I understand the law at this time, I can use this public facility to approve of sexual perversion and call it an alternate lifestyle, and if someone is offended, that's OK.  I can use it to condone sexual promiscuity by dispensing condoms and calling it safe sex. If someone is offended, that's OK.  I can even use this public facility to present the merits of killing an unborn baby  as a viable means of birth control. If someone is offended, it's no problem.  I can designate a school day as earth day and involve students in activities to religiously worship and praise the goddess, mother earth, and call it ecology.  I can use literature, videos and presentations in the classroom that depict people with strong, traditional, Christian convictions as simple minded and ignorant and call it enlightenment.  However, if anyone uses this facility to honor God and ask Him to bless this event with safety and good sportsmanship, Federal Case Law is violated.  This appears to be inconsistent at best, and at worst, diabolical.  Apparently, we are to be tolerant of everything and anyone except God and His Commandments.  Nevertheless, as a school principal, I frequently ask staff and students to abide by rules that they do not necessarily agree. For me to do otherwise would be inconsistent at best, and at worst, hypocritical. I suffer from that affliction enough unintentionally. I certainly do not need to add an intentional transgression.  For this reason, I shall render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's and refrain from praying at this time. However, if you feel inspired to honor, praise and thank God, and ask Him in the name of Jesus to bless this event, please feel free to do so. As far as I know, that's not against the law — yet.    AND ... one by one, the people in the stands bowed their heads, held hands with one another, and began to pray. They prayed in the stands. They prayed in the team huddles. They pray at the concession stand. And they prayed in the announcer's box. The only place they didn't pray was in the Supreme Court of the United State's of America — the seat of justice in the one nation under God.  Somehow, Kingston, Tennessee, remembered what so many have forgotten ... we are given the Freedom OF Religion, not the Freedom FROM Religion.  Praise God that His remnant remains!",

I gathered my items and went to the 10 and under register to check-out. The person in front of me (a white female, approximate age 35-43, fake nails, big braided hair do, clean clothes, carrying a purse and a plastic drinking cup) put her purchase on the checkout surface - ONE GRAPE.  Yes, that is correct ONE GRAPE. The cashier asked if that was all, she replied yes. The cashier then weighted the GRAPE and told the women the cost was $.02 (TWO CENTS), the women then pulled out her Food Stamp EBT card and swiped it through the credit card machine, requesting $24.00 in cash back. The cashier asked if she wanted the GRAPE, the woman replied no and the GRAPE was put in the garbage can. The register recorded the sale as .02, cash back $24.00. The cashier then asked if two fives would be okay because was out of tens, the woman agreed and took the $24.00 folded it up and put it in her pocket and left the store.  As the next person in line I asked the cashier as a taxpayer what in the hell just happened here she said she was on the clock and could not comment. I then asked if I had actually seen this person purchase and discard a GRAPE, then get cash back on her Food Stamp EBT card. The cashier responded that it happens all day every day in their store. She also said that if the person buying the GRAPE has it rung up over .02 they get mad and make her reweigh it.  My next comment was to ask the cashier if she planned to vote in November and she said she could hardly wait for 11/6/12 to get here as one taxpayer to another.",

When I went into the store I noticed a couple of guys driving around the parking lot in a dark van and I made a mental note of their presence. I made my purchases, left the store and didn't see the van so I proceeded to my car with confidence. Well, as I was unlocking my car door, one of the men grabbed me around the waist and was pulling me to the van. I put up a fight, kicking, scratching, hitting him with my cell phone, and screaming...I received help from a man leaving the store with his wife.  The man let me go and ran for the van where his partner was waiting and they drove off. After I stopped shaking, thanked the man prefusely, I got in my car and left to go home. Before I got to my subdivision, the van was behind my car. At this point, I wouldn't enter my subdivision (I didn't want them to know where I lived) and I started driving around and call the 911 operator. The 911 operator relied my call to the local police department and between the 911 operator and the police they were advising me what to do until they could reach me. Finally, the police told me to exit at the next street and give them the intersection I was at. When I did this, the van came up on my right and sat there watching me, waiting for me to make a move, I told the 911 operator I was slowly backing up to the highway and the van was moving towards me. At this point, the police showed up and the men in the van sped past us very quickly. The police were able to get the license plate and description of the vehicle as they sped off. The police called for assistance and gave me an escort home. Upon talking with a friend of mine yesterday, she informed me that I was the 3rd woman this had happened to this past week.  So, please everyone be very careful out there, don't take anything for granted and if this happens to you please put up a fight and draw attention to the situation. This may be the only thing that saves you. ",

Her room was located on the third floor of the building, the door was locked, and there was no ledge outside her window. Her roommate awoke in the morning, having heard nothing unusual overnight and simply assumed that Elizabeth had left to go to class early. The roommate later told investigators that when she noticed the handprint, she screamed and knew immediately that everything Elizabeth had been talking about was true. It was real.  The previous evening, Elizabeth had remarked to her friends that she’d had a strange experience walking back to her dorm from a late night dance rehearsal. As she made her way across campus, she gradually got the uneasy feeling that someone was watching and following her. “She seemed so relieved to be back in her room again,” her roommate said.  No trace if Elizabeth has yet been found, and investigators have called it the most baffling missing person case of their careers. Since the above image has been circulating the internet for nearly two years, it is difficult to say for certain if it is genuine, although it matches what students and investigators have described (note its size in relation to the coffee pot in the foreground). Remarked Detective Stephen Broze, You'd think our suspect would be pretty easy to spot. He must stick out in a crowd with eleven-inch fingers.",

After the Dr. evaluated her stomach and ran urine tested, she checked for tenderness, she found the area that was causing my daughter the pain.  The Dr. then asked about what my daughter ate on a regular basis as well as what she had had within the last few days. (Keep in mind that we are pretty consistent with eating healthy and my daughter was having about 3 small bags of takis a month.) When my daughter told her she had takis, the Dr. warned her right away about the dangers of that product.  The Dr. mentioned how she had a 16 month old patient in the hospital with throat cancer due to those chips! The toddles teeth failed to grow because even his gums were affected and now the toddler is at The Children's Hospital in LA undergoing chemo. The Dr. also advised me NOT to allow my children to eat ANY of those hot chips. The product that they use to make them is harsh on the mouth, throat, and stomach.  PLEASE spread the word! STOP eating takis and hot chips!!! She explained how the harsh chemicals and seasoning in the chips cause corrosion in the throat and stomach. It is causing stomach ulcers in children. My daughter was given a 10 day treatment plan to prevent ulcers as the pain her her stomach was severe. PLEASE believe it and read up on the info online for yourself! I am making sure that everyone I come in contact with is aware of what we are unconsciously doing to ourselves and our children when we eat those things!",

        "tweet": "An Open Letter to Terrorists and Those Who Harbor and Support You  From an American Grandfather:  I am told by the leaders of my government that you are intelligent people. In light of your actions, I am having growing difficulty believing that. At the very least, it has become increasingly obvious that you lack a fundamental comprehension of my psychology as an American. I hear on our news broadcasts that your rage is fueled by my support of Israel. It has never been about nationality or religious faith - never about Jew vs. Arab. I thought you would finally have understood that when I sent my children into harm's way in order to protect the innocent citizens of Arab Kuwait from the savage wolf who would devour them for his own gain. It has everything to do with the lessons taught to me by my father - and his before him for many generations before the white man came to this land we call America.  I have a vivid memory of coming home, as a boy of about nine years of age, and telling my father of feeling helpless horror as I watched the neighborhood bully unmercifully torment a boy even smaller than myself. My father reflected for a long moment, then quietly inquired of me as to what I had done about it. I said that I had watched until it was over and had then come home. The look in his eyes penetrated me to my core for he had never looked at me in that way before. He said that he was deeply ashamed of me and he sent me to my room with instructions to think about what had happened. It seemed hours before he came to my door. He sat beside me on my bed and, for a painfully long while, he said nothing.  When finally he spoke, he explained, There will always be among us dishonorable men who are devoid of humanity and compassion. They are but naked animals and an empty shell of what truly is a man. They attempt to fill their emptiness by the exercise of power over others, thinking that it makes them whole men. Often they are enraged that they do not even understand their own emptiness, what it is that they lack. When these men are also cowards, they disguise themselves as sheep among the flock and attack from the shadows. This is the vilest form of sub-human behavior for even animals attack openly when they must attack. When humanity and integrity are present in a man, he expresses them as compassion. When compassion and strength achieve perfect balance within a man, they manifest as wisdom. The compassionate man feels the pain of others. The wise man protects others from pain. For, if you watch and do nothing to protect others, who will come to your aide when you alone remain and the bully comes for you? Some things are far more important than your personal safety and freedom from pain. If ever again you see someone being hurt, protect him, even if you are certain to be injured in the process. Then I will know that I have truly raised a  man  Anyone who understands the impact of this lesson - and how deeply it runs in the man I have become, will understand my unflinching willingness to sacrifice my children in defense of Arab and Jew alike when they are threatened by the bullies and cowards of the world. And please do not insult my intelligence with claims of Jewish treatment of Palestinians. I am old enough to retain vivid memories of 1948. I remember the excitement of the Jews over the prospect of governing with them. Their reaction, and that of their neighbors, was to attempt to finish what the Nazis could not -repeatedly.  Intelligent men? I, for one, am stunned by the monumental stupidity of your arrogance. Did you actually think that only Americans would occupy the World Trade Center? You have but fired the first pitiful salvo of World War III for the entire world is now preparing to come after you, your host, your financers and your supporters. And please, do not listen to what I say. You would do far better to watch the sky.  I must say that I owe you a profound debt of gratitude. Not for what you have done or what you have unleashed upon the world, but for what you have accomplished. For not one among us could have accomplished it. On Monday, September 10, 2001, we were a divisive, apathetic nation. Our young people had nothing by which to identify with our history or heritage our people were divided by factions of religion and skin color our government was polarized and paralyzed by political party affiliation, able to agree upon nothing the military had difficulty obtaining volunteers and most of us simply changed TV channels in response to Red Cross pleas for blood donations. Your actions have changed all of that in a way that has occurred only twice before in the history of this nation - once in 1776 and again on December 7, 1941. The worst in the worst of Allah's children has brought out the best in the best of Allah's children and, for this, I thank you.  Since your cowardly act, Muslim, Jew, Christian, black, white, yellow and brown have stood shoulder to shoulder for hours in the hot sun to donate blood for the injured. Our government has suddenly become totally united in it's purpose. Our military is having difficulty handling the flood of volunteers from among our young people. Our flag makers report that there is no way humanly possible that they can keep up with the demand — shipments are sold out within minutes. You have accomplished a miracle that only God could have anticipated.  And, it would seem, the hand of God was present even in the date that you selected for your attack, for you could not have chosen a date more in keeping with a reawakening of American pride and purpose. There is in America a nationwide system for seeking help in times of emergency. Every American knows that, when threatened, he can pick up any telephone and dial 911 and help is immediately on the way to assist and protect him. By selecting September, (our 9th month), 11, 2001 to exhibit your cowardice, you unwittingly placed a 911 call that has brought all of America together in a way that brings tears of joy and pride to my eyes. No longer is our battle cry, Remember Pearl Harbor! Thanks to you and your kind it will now and forevermore be, Remember 911! whenever the innocents of any nation find themselves threatened by cowards with guns.  I do not, for a moment, deny that you hurt me. Far too many parents and children now go to bed wondering where their loved ones are. And, yes, I am momentarily reeling. But it is from the sudden realization that I share the planet with anyone capable of such an atrocity against the humanity of so many nations.  In his Inaugural Address in Washington, D.C. on January 20, 1961, President John F. Kennedy said, Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty. He was talking about the liberty of all men, of all faiths, of all nations.  You need to understand that the truth of that statement is the very fabric of who and what I am. I wish neither to rule nor to inflict injury upon the innocents of any nation. I am the lion who sleeps with God's lambs to protect them from ravenous wolves who would devour them. Your 911 call has awakened the lion and now I hunger for the flesh of wolves.  In closing let me state, Muhammad taught that Allah is a God of love- yet you have the unmitigated gall to bastardize Islam to suit your own personal, unholy agenda. Who now is the infidel?",

They have restaurants in Charleston SC, Mt. Pleasant SC, Marietta GA, Athens GA, Charlottesville VA, and Greenville SC as well.  Also, they are preparing to go national. Last weekend (the weekend of March 22, 2003), five Marines from the Beaufort air station went to Wild Wings as numerous Marines frequently do on the weekends. This time, they were asked to leave. They were not drunk. One of them does not drink at all, and the others had not started drinking yet. When asked why they had to leave, the response was We do not support the war, and your presence here is a disruption.  I heard this last week, and have been bighting my tongue until I could verify this. I have not only verified this 100% with one of the Marines I have known for a couple of years, but the story has grown. Word of mouth spread the story quickly on this island as well as the local military bases. One of the civilian employees of the Beaufort Air Station actually called the local radio station and the DJ broadcast the story. Needless to say, business was off at Wild Wings last week.  What might the owners response have been? Would they apologize? NO! In fact, they did the opposite. They called the CO of the Beaufort Air Station demanding an apology from the Marines for causing their business to drop by spreading this story! The CO decided that Wild Wings did not deserve an apology. Nor did it deserve any more Marine dollars. Wild Wings is now off limits to the Marines of Beaufort Air Station.  I have always been very wary of spreading stories I heard on the internet. However, I know this one to be true. I heard it from the source.  There are people out there who do not support this war. I am well aware of that. However, if you do not support the members of our military, you do not deserve the freedoms they fight to protect. You do not deserve to run a business in this country. You do not deserve to profit in this country. And, since without our military you would not have freedom of speech, you do not deserve to express an opinion in this country.  I hope that each of you will consider this story before you spend one dime in a Wild Wings establishment.  Erik Smith",

        "tweet": "Warning-be aware / Ladies Please Read !!!!!  The Latest Scam:  The way the scam works is, a man slips into a women's restroom and sneaks into a stall. He waits until there is only one woman in the restroom in a neighboring stall.  The criminal then stands on the toilet and points a hand gun into the next stall, demanding the woman's valuables. After getting her cash and jewelry, he demands that she remove all of her clothing and kick them out of the stall. The thief tosses the clothing into a shopping bag, hangs an out of order sign on the restroom door and slips back into the mall. The out of order sign ensures no one will soon come to the woman's rescue. It usually takes an hour or two for the woman to work up the nerve to leave the restroom in the nude, giving the criminal ample time to make his get away. The woman is left naked and humiliated in a mall full of strangers.  The best defense, say police, is to never go into a shopping mall restroom alone, as only women who are by themselves are targeted. PLEASE FORWARD THIS TO EVERYONE YOU KNOW. This has so far been a nearly perfect crime, as none of the perpetrators have been caught. Don't let this happen to another woman.",
