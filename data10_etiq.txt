        "tweet": "Information Bulletin  New Drug - JENKEM  On 09/19/07 Cpl. Disarro received and email from a concerned parent regarding a new drug called Jenkem. The parent advised their child learned about this drug through various conversations with several students at Palmetto Ridge High.  Jenkem originated in Africa and other third world countries by fermenting raw sewage to create a gas which is inhaled to achieve a high. Jenkem is now a popular drug in American Schools. Jenkem is a homemade substance which consists of fecal matter and urine. The fecal matter and urine are placed in a bottle or jar and covered most commonly with a balloon. The container is then placed in a sunny area for several hours or days until fermented. The contents of the container will separate and release a gas, which is captured in the balloon. Inhaling the gas is said to have a euphoric high similar to ingesting cocaine but with strong hallucinations of times past.  Once ingested the onset of the high takes approximately 10 seconds with the most severe hallucinations happening in approximately 20 minutes. Several articles indicate that the subject immediately passes out after ingesting the gas then regains a magical/hallucinogenic state within seconds of regaining consciousness. The high has been described by subjects as a feeling of being out of it and talking to dead people. The feeling of being out of it may last for several hours or days.  All subjects who used the Jenkem disliked the taste of sewage in their mouth and the fact that the taste continued for several days.  Slang terms: Winnie, Shit, Runners, Fruit from Crack Pipe, Leroy Jenkems, Might, Butthash, and Waste.  Click here for bulletin.",

Alors que la Société TRANSPOLE vient  d’augmenter ses tarifs à l’égard des usagers de 7%, elle applique dans le même temps la gratuité de ses transports aux Roms. En effet, la direction de cette société a informé son personnel des exigences extravagantes de Mme Martine Aubry-Brochen, présidente de la Communauté Urbaine de Lille et par conséquent  le véritable patron de Transpole : il faut laisser monter gratuitement les Roms dans les Transports en commun de la métropole et ne jamais leur demander leur titre de transport. Cet ordre, parfaitement illégal puisqu’il rompt de manière scandaleuse avec le principe d’égalité, a été énoncé verbalement, selon le personnel. Le Front National constate une fois de plus que  pour les Socialistes et pour Martine Aubry-Brochen, la priorité va d’abord aux étrangers. Il relève que lorsque le Front National défend la priorité nationale, les socialistes n’hésitent pas à l’accuser de racisme au nom justement de l’égalité entre tous les hommes… Il en conclut que pour Mme Aubry-Brochen, les « grands principes » sont à géométrie variable… Il souhaite également que la presse et les médias audiovisuels fassent la lumière sur ces dérives  arbitraires.

Comme quoi les dirigeants ont tout compris chez nous… Mais ce qui me déglingue encore un peu plus, c’est que quasi la totalité d’entre eux (toutes provenances confondues) sont musulmans,  probablement pratiquants vu les âges et ils viennent bosser dans la restauration, qui plus est en montagne.. et qu’est-ce qu’on mange le plus souvent en  montagne l’hiver? Ben des diots, des raclettes, des tartiflettes, des fondues avec  l’assiette de charcuterie qui va bien… bref du PORC!! Alors ils en font quoi de leur religion et des ses putains de  principes quand ils doivent trancher et disposer le jambon, le saucisson, le  lard et le reste dans les plats et sur les assiettes hein ???!!!!! C’est pas du « halal » là !!!!!! Pour 5000 ¤, y a plus d’Allah et de sa volonté  divine???Chapeau la bouffe traditionnelle montagnarde française.. préparée par des cuistots du pays… avec amour et savoir-faire ancestral… mon cul  oui!!!Alors voilà, je vous invite à faire passer le mot mais surtout à BOYCOTTER ces groupes hôteliers « aux pieds des pistes » pour privilégier les petits chalets ou chambres d’hôtes et les restaurants « bien de chez nous », ce qui souvent, revient moins cher pour le séjour une fois tout ajouté.",

        "tweet": "When I was at Camp Pendleton receiving combat corpsman training, I noticed that the pickup truck belonging to the gunnery sergeant in charge of our training was adorned with bumper stickers containing extremely unflattering remarks about Jane Fonda. I also noticed a few referred to Ms. Fonda and Vietnam, but at the time I honestly had no idea why.  Being an E-5 and close to rank to our E-7 gunny, after a training rotation one afternoon I decided to ask him about those stickers, and what they had to do with Fonda.  He muttered a few obscenities and proceeded to tell me the story. Fonda, he said, became a traitor during the Vietnam War — a war in which gunny had served two tours and for which he had received three Purple Hearts (which is why he enjoyed training Navy corpsmen to be Marine Corps combat corpsmen — they'd saved his life a time or two).  The following excerpts are not gunny's words, but when received them in an e-mail recently, it reminded me of his story. And, as ABC's Barbara Walters prepares to honor the traitorous Jane Fonda during Walters' 100 years of great women program soon, I thought the American people needed to hear this story again. You see, Fonda isn't just exercise videos and the third wheel in Nine to Five (the movie). * * * * * * * There are few things I have strong visceral reactions to, but Jane Fonda's participation in what I believe to be blatant treason, is one of them. Part of my conviction comes from exposure to those who suffered her attentions.  In 1978, the Commandant of the USAF Survival School, a colonel, was a former POW in Ho Lo Prison — the Hanoi Hilton. Dragged from a stinking cesspit of a cell, cleaned, fed, and dressed in clean PJs, he was ordered to describe for a visiting American 'Peace Activist' the 'lenient and humane treatment' he'd received. He spat at Ms. Fonda, was clubbed, and dragged away. During the subsequent beating, he fell forward upon the camp Commandant's feet, accidentally pulling the man's shoe off — which sent that officer berserk.  In '78, the AF colonel still suffered from double vision — permanently grounding him — from the Vietnamese officer's frenzied application of a wooden baton.  From 1983-85, Col. Larry Carrigan was 347FW/DO (F-4Es). He'd spent 6 [product] years in the Hilton — the first three of which he was listed as MIA. His wife lived on faith that he was still alive. His group, too, got the cleaned/fed/clothed routine in preparation for a 'peace delegation' visit.  They, however, had time and devised a plan to get word to the world that they still survived. Each man secreted a tiny piece of paper, with his Social Security number on it, in the palm of his hand. When paraded before Ms. Fonda and a cameraman, she walked the line, shaking each man's hand and asking little encouraging snippets like, 'Aren't you sorry you bombed babies?' and, 'Are you grateful for the humane treatment from your benevolent captors?'  Believing this HAD to be an act, they each palmed her their sliver of paper. She took them all without missing a beat. At the end of the line and once the camera stopped rolling, to the shocked disbelief of the POWs, she turned to the officer in charge ... and handed him the little pile of notes.  Three men died from the subsequent beatings. Col. Carrigan was almost number four.  For years after their release, a group of determined former POWs, including Col. Carrigan, tried to bring Ms. Fonda and others up on charges of treason. I don't know that they used it, but the charge of 'Negligent Homicide due to Depraved Indifference' would also seem appropriate. Her obvious 'granting of aid and comfort to the enemy' alone should've been sufficient for the treason count. However, to date, Jane Fonda has never been formally charged with anything and continues to enjoy the privileged life of the rich and famous.  I, personally, think that this is shame on us, the American Citizenry.  Part of our shortfall is ignorance: Most don't know such actions ever took place.  The only addition I might add to these sentiments is to remember the satisfaction of relieving myself into the urinal at some air base or another where 'zaps' of Hanoi Jane's face had been applied.  And there is this account:  I was a civilian economic development advisor in Vietnam, and was captured by the North Vietnamese communists in South Vietnam in 1968, and held for over 5 years. I spent 27 months in solitary confinement, one year in a cage in Cambodia, and one year in a 'black box' in Hanoi. My North Vietnamese captors deliberately poisoned and murdered a female missionary, a nurse in a leprosarium in Ban Me Thuot, South Vietnam, whom I later buried in the jungle near the Cambodian border.  At one time, I was weighing approximately 90 lb. [my normal weight is 170 lb.). We were Jane Fonda's 'war criminals.'  When Jane Fonda was in Hanoi, I was asked by the camp communist political officer if I would be willing to meet with her. I said yes, for I would like to tell her about the real treatment we POWs were receiving, which was far different from the treatment purported by the North Vietnamese, and parroted by Jane Fonda, as 'humane and lenient.' Because of this, I spent three days on a rocky floor on my knees with outstretched arms with a piece of steel re-bar placed on my hands, and beaten with a bamboo cane every time my arms dipped.  Jane Fonda had the audacity to say that the POWs were lying about our torture and treatment. Now ABC is allowing Barbara Walters to honor Jane Fonda in her feature 100 Years of Great Women. Shame on the Disney Company.  I had the opportunity to meet with Jane Fonda for a couple of hours after I was released. I asked her if she would be willing to debate me on TV. She did not answer me, her husband (at the time), Tom Hayden, answered for her. She was mind controlled by her husband. This does not exemplify someone who should be honored by '100 Years of Great Women.'  After I was released, I was asked what I thought of Jane Fonda and the anti-war movement. I said that I held Joan Baez's husband in very high regard, for he thought the war was wrong, burned his draft card and went to prison in protest. If the other anti-war protesters took this same route, it would have brought our judicial system to a halt and ended the war much earlier, and there wouldn't be as many on that somber black granite wall called the Vietnam Memorial. This is democracy. This is the American way.  Jane Fonda, on the other hand, chose to be a traitor, and went to Hanoi, wore their uniform, propagandized for the communists, and urged American soldiers to desert. As we were being tortured, and some of the POWs murdered, she called us liars. After her heroes — the North Vietnamese communists — took over South Vietnam, they systematically murdered 80,000 South Vietnamese political prisoners. May their souls rest on her head forever.  In the words of Paul Harvey, America, now you know the rest of the story.  ABC and Babs Walters will undoubtedly include Hanoi Jane in their televised celebration because their black souls are too hardened and too imbued with an anti-American sentiment to do anything else. And ultimately, they will all answer for what they have done in their lives. In the meantime, I don't plan on watching anything that has Jane Fonda's face anywhere near it. I won't buy her videos I won't rent or go see her movies. As far as I'm concerned, she's already dead to me.  Whether or not you agreed with the war in Vietnam, whether you're a Vietnam vet or a former member of the protest movement, or whether you're too old or too young to have been there, the behavior of Jane Fonda towards our own military men is reprehensible beyond belief. All I ask is that you think about these accounts the next time you see her. Let your conscience guide your actions from there.",

Assignment: Please translate the following Rap song lyrics from Ebonics to standard English.  Artist: Notorious B.I.G.  Album: Ready to Die  Song: One more chance (remix)  Lyrics:  First things first, I poppa, freaks all the honeys  Dummies — playboy bunnies, those wantin' money  Those the ones I like 'cause they don't get nathan'  But penetration, unless it smells like sanitation  Garbage, I turn like doorknobs  Heart throb, never, black and ugly as ever  However, I stay coochied down to the socks  Rings and watch filled with rocks  TRANSLATION:  As a general rule, I perform deviant sexual acts with women of all kinds, including but not limited to those with limited intellect, nude magazine models, and prostitutes. I particularly enjoy sexual encounters with the latter group as they are generally disappointed in the fact that they only receive penile intercourse and nothing more, unless of course, they douche on a consistent basis. Although I am extremely unattractive, I am able to engage in these types of sexual acts with some regularity. Perhaps my sexuality is somehow related to my fancy and expensive jewelry.  Lyrics:  And my jam knock in the Mitsubishi  Girls pee pee when they see me,  Nava-hoes creep me in they tee pee  As I lay down laws like I lay carpet  Stop it — if you think your gonna make a profit  TRANSLATION:  I enjoy playing my music loudly on my car stereo. Apparently, women enjoy this also because they become sexually aroused when they see me driving. Oddly enough, when I visit the Native American reservations, some of the more sexually promiscuous Indian women attempt to seduce me in their homes. Their intent is to divest me of my earnings. Such actions are unacceptable.  Lyrics:  Don’t see my ones, don't see my guns — get it  Now tell ya friends Poppa hit it then split it  In two as I flow with the Junior Mafia  I don't know what the hell’s stoppin' ya  I'm clockin' ya — Versace shades watchin' ya  Once ya grin, I'm in game, begin  TRANSLATION:  Understand this fact: you can have neither my money, nor my weapons. I suggest that you inform your peers that we engaged in violent sexual acts. Currently, I am rapping with my associates, the Junior Mafia. I'm having some difficulty understanding why you refuse to approach me. I am attempting to make eye contact with you through my expensive glasses, and as soon as you respond with a smile, I will approach you.  Lyrics:  First I talk about how I dress and this  And diamond necklaces — stretch Lexuses  The sex is just immaculate from the back I get  Deeper and deeper — help ya reach the  Climax that your man can't make  Call and tell him you'll be home real late  Let’s sing the break  TRANSLATION:  I prefer to open the conversation with light banter about my wardrobe and jewelry, then I like to discuss my collection of expensive cars. This is more than enough to convince you to have sexual intercourse with me. I am able to insert my penis further into you when I enter you from behind. Furthermore, you will be able to reach orgasm. I understand this to be a problem with your current sexual partner. He needn't be concerned about your whereabouts. Please phone him and inform him that you won't be home for a while. By the way, please sing the chorus of the song for me also.  Lyrics:  She's sick of that song on how it's so long  Thought he worked his until I handled my biz  There I is — major pain like Damon Wayans  Low down dirty even like his brother Keenan  Schemin' — don't bring your girl 'round me  True player for real, ask Puff Daddy  TRANSLATION:  Your current love interest no longer wishes to hear your fabrications about the length of your member. After I had sexual intercourse with your woman, she became enlightened as to the proper way it is supposed to be performed violently and immorally. It would be in your best interest to keep your woman away from me as my sexual prowess is very strong. If you are unconvinced, ask Puff Daddy.  Lyrics:  You — ringin' bells with bags from Chanel  Baby Benz, traded in your Hyundai Excel  Fully equipped, CD changer with the cell  She beeped me, meet me at twelve  TRANSLATION:  Despite the fact that you attempted to win her at her doorstep with bags full of expensive clothes and a car (the lower end model Mercedes Benz which you financed by signing over your current vehicle) containing an expensive stereo and a cellular phone, your woman has contacted me through my pager indicating that we should rendezvous at midnight.  Lyrics:  Where you at? Flippin' jobs, playin' car notes?  While I'm swimmin' in ya women like the breast stroke  Right stroke, left stroke, what's the best stroke?  Death stroke — tongue all down her throat  Nuthin' left to do but send her home to you  I'm through — can ya sing the song for me, boo?  TRANSLATION:  You, on the other hand, jump from job to job, barely able to maintain payments on the Mercedes Benz you purchased for your woman. Meanwhile, I continue to engage in sexual intercourse and commit lewd osculatory acts with your women. My only remaining option is to request that she leave my home and return to you because I have reached orgasm and no longer have a need for her presence.  Lyrics:  So, what's it gonna be? Him or me?  We can cruise the world with pearls  Gator boots for girls  The envy of all women, crushed linen  Cartier wrist-wear with diamonds in 'em  The finest women I love with a passion  Ya man's a wimp, I give that ass a good thrashin'  TRANSLATION:  The ultimate decision rests with you. Whom do you choose as your sexual partner? I can take you on cruises around the world. I will dress you in the finest jewelry and footwear. You will be envied by women worldwide in your fine clothes and jewelry. There is a special place in my heart for beautiful women. I will defeat your man in an altercation because he is effeminate.  Lyrics:  High fashion — flyin' into all states.  Sexin' me while your man masturbates.  Isn't this great? Your flight leaves at eight.  Her flight lands at nine, my game just rewinds.  Lyrically I'm supposed to represent.  I'm not only the client, I'm the player president  TRANSLATION:  You will be dressed in finest clothes on the runways of Paris. I will fly you to every state to shop for fine clothes and jewelry. You will enjoy sexual intercourse with me and your man will be forced to pleasure himself through manual stimulation. What a life! I’ll return you to LaGuardia in time to catch your 8 o'clock flight. The timing is perfect because I have scheduled a date with a second woman who arrives at the same gate at 9 o'clock. I'll seduce her in the same way that I seduced you. I rap well and I am a positive reflection of my home town. Not only am I a sexually deviant, misogynistic, immoral, wealthy, male prostitute, but I also sit on the board of directors of the organization that governs others of my kind.",

He has surrendered his life to the Lord Jesus Christ, and announced it to the public several days ago. However, there's hardly been any information about it. If he had announced he was GAY, the TV shows and all the media and newspapers would have given it full coverage. Why hasn't this announcement — accepting Jesus as Saviour — not hit the news? Because it has no rating, it pays no publicity and it is politically dangerous. I have therefore decided to announce it here, in Facebook, because there was a great celebration that took place in Heaven. Let's all share this and celebrate it! MY LOVE TO YOU, DEAR BROTHER SYLVESTER!",

It seems the two crooks never learned two things, they were in Montana and Patricia had been a clay shooting champion since she was nine. Patricia was in her upstairs room when the two men broke through the front door of the house. She quickly ran to her father's room and grabbed his 12 gauge Mossberg 500 shotgun.  Resindez was the first to get up to the second floor only to be the first to catch a near point blank blast of buck shot from the 11 year olds knee crouch aim. He suffered fatal wounds to his abdomen and genitals. When Garza ran to the foot of the stairs, he took a blast to the left shoulder and staggered out into the street where he bled to death before medical help could arrive.  It was found out later that Resindez was armed with a stolen 45 caliber handgun he took from another home invasion robbery. The victim, 50 year old David Burien, was not so lucky as he died from stab wounds to the chest.",

I decided to contact him to get the real and full scoop on H1N1. Since he does government research he was able to access everything we want to know about H1N1 and he also contacted top docs in infectious disease at Johns Hopkins. Here is the dirt: The CDC says H1N1 is currently wiping out entire villages in Asia . They expect it to hit the US in Jan/Feb where it will kill 6 out of 10 people. It HAS mutated. (Throw out the conspiracy theory) They will attempt a program of mandatory vaccinations but probably will not have enough time to enforce it. I will not be vaccinated. The last time they did mandatory vaccinations at least one person died and many others developed Guillain-Barré syndrome, which is a devastating illness. They have not let the public know because they don’t want people to panic, but to people who know, they are suggesting the following: Start stocking up on food now. They expect that martial law will be put into effect. You won’t be able to go to work or shop for food – you will be shot. Buy facial masks made by 3M - #N95. Use Purell obsessively. Oh, this is interesting: This pandemic was predicted years ago by a Russian mathematician. It’s impetus was the Tsunami a few years ago.  I know that by spreading this information I’m taking the risk of looking like an alarmist, but this is straight from the mouths of the CDC and Johns Hopkins. ",

A young couple with their baby were traveling on I-77 when a car of 4 black males came up beside them on the interstate and started waving a gun at them for them to stop. They kept going and the car followed them for 20 miles waving the gun and harassing them. At approximately mile marker 47 they saw a highway patrolman and flashed their lights at him, the patrolman pulled out behind them unfortunately at the 48 mile marker the couple slammed on brakes and lost control of the car having a terrible accident. Wayne said it didn't look as if anyone got seriously hurt - they were just very scared.  Wayne talked to the highway patrolman who told them that this is a Gang Initiation thing coming out of Charlotte. If you stop, they shoot you - and if you don't stop, they continue to attempt to get you to stop. They have been unable to catch these people in the act - just getting the reports afterwards.  Thankfully, this couple and their baby were okay. I made sure I passed this on to my kids -pass it on to your friends and family as well. I cannot imagine how scared this couple must have been.",

Don't thank me. I'm a giver. Here we go:  The Palestinians want their own country. There's just one thing about that: There are no Palestinians. It's a made up word. Israel was called Palestine for two thousand years. Like Wiccan, Palestinian sounds ancient but is really a modern invention.  Before the Israelis won the land in war, Gaza was owned by Egypt, and there were no Palestinians then, and the West Bank was owned by Jordan, and there were no Palestinians then. As soon as the Jews took over and started growing oranges as big as basketballs, what do you know, say hello to the Palestinians, weeping for their deep bond with their lost land and nation.  So for the sake of honesty, let's not use the word Palestinian any more to describe these delightful folks, who dance for joy at our deaths until someone points out they're being taped. Instead, let's call them what they are: Other Arabs From The Same General Area Who Are In Deep Denial About Never Being Able To Accomplish Anything In Life And Would Rather Wrap Themselves In The Seductive Melodrama Of Eternal Struggle And Death. I know that's a bit unwieldy to expect to see on CNN. How about this, then: Adjacent Jew-Haters.  [Rest of article here.]",

D’abord, lire, dans l’ordre, l’article de Pierre Cassen sur Boulevard Voltaire, La Chasse au Zemmour est ouverte, puis celui de  Lucette Jeanpierre sur Riposte laïque Les curieuses méthodes du journaleux Sébastien Lafargue pour salir Eric Zemmour. Ensuite, s’attaquer au montage du petit monsieur Lafargue qui, se prenant sans doute pour Hitchcock -mégalomanie et narcissisme expliquant bien des choses, mais quand on n’a pas le talent ni le génie… glisse une image de lui au début de son reportage :– Les chiffres de l’immigration : Eric Zemmour serait un menteur qui dirait n’importe quoi ? 1 ) Etrangers ou immigrés ? Eric Zemmour parle de 5 millions d’étrangers et 7 millions d’enfants de moins de 4 ans, s’appuyant sur un rapport de l’Insee. Un petit monsieur ayant participé au rapport cité par Eric Zemmour, interviewé par celui qui se voudrait Hitchcock et n’est qu’un journaleux à la solde du pouvoir, ricane et affirme sans rire qu’il y aurait en France  3,7 millions d’étrangers en France. On trouve facilement sur le net le rapport de l’insee de 2012, avec les chiffres  mêmes cités par Eric Zemmour  et une mine d’or pour l »étude de la population immigrée  fichesthematiques-insee-populationimmigree-2012  Même le Figaro avait relayé à l »époque les chiffres. Le seul élément que je n’aie pas trouvé est la mention des « enfants de moins de 4 ans étrangers « évoquée par Zemmour, je ne sais où il l’a trouvée. Il semble qu’il parle en fait du nombre de mineurs étrangers et non d’enfants de 4 ans. Alors, le petit monsieur de l’Insee et le petit journaleux Lafargue assènent sans état d’âme un chiffre destiné à faire passer Eric Zemmour pour un menteur (on attend de savoir pourquoi le sieur Langlard n’a pas démenti en 2012 les chiffres parus dans le rapport qu’il a cosigné….), il y aurait en fait « 3,7 millions d’étrangers en France aujourd’hui ». Les comparses se gardent bien de dire qu‘ils ne comptent pas les enfants, eux, ni que les immigrés nés avec la nationalité française comme certains Algériens ne sont pas comptés dans le tableau ci-dessous, ni que  le rythme des naturalisations s’est emballé, ni qu’ils ne comptent  pas, justement, les étrangers ayant acquis la nationalité française. La manipulation c’est que Eric Zemmour parle des immigrés (5 millions effectivement dans le tableau ci-dessous, avec ceux qui ont obtenu la nationalité française ) qu’il appelle, « étrangers », traduisant ainsi le sentiment de tous les Français lassés de tous ces « Français de papier  » qui haïssent la France  et que Langlard parle des étrangers… pas encore français ! On n’oubliera pas qu’il s’agit d’ailleurs de la part émergée de l’iceberg, l’immigration légale et recensée… ni qu’en 2008, déjà,40% des immigrés avaient la nationalité française : partimmigresayantnationalitefrancaise  Il en est de même pour les mariages mixtes, Zemmour  annonçant qu’un tiers des 270000 mariages annuels se ferait avec des étrangers, nos manipulateurs contestent et réduisent le chiffre à 13%… Facile puisqu’ils ne comptent en effet que les mariages avec un étranger et non avec un immigré naturalisé, ce qui change tout. Sans parler des mariages célébrés à l’étranger, même Libé donne raison à Zemmour, c’est dire !Bref, on brouille les statistiques à dessein pour que les Français s’imaginent avoir la berlue quand ils se promènent dans Paris ou Marseille…  ou à Orléans : parents_elevesecolecoranique Parce que, répétons-le une fois de plus, ce qui pose question avec l’immigration, c’est non seulement qu’ouvrir grand nos portes en période de chômage et de crise économique est un non-sens mais qu’en sus l’immigration est majoritairement musulmane et met en danger nos traditions et nos valeurs. 3) Chaque année, plus de 400000 immigrés recensés s’installent définitivement sur notre territoire. On fera un simple calcul. Le spécialiste de l’Insee dit qu’il y a à peu près 800000 naissances en france chaque année, ce qui est vrai,  et il y a à peu près 500000 décès. Ce qui fait un solde démographique lié aux naissances de 300000 par an.  Or, si l’on compare les chiffres, on constate que la France, en 2008, avait 62130519 habitants, qu’elle en a en 2013 65800000, que nous avons donc « pris » 3670000   habitants en 5 ans. Pendant ces mêmes 5 années, nous avons eu un solde démographique net de 300000X5 soit 1500000 personnes. Les chiffres nous disent donc que le solde migratoire est de 3670000 moins 1500000 soit 2 millions deux cent mille  immigrés en sus, soit 405000 par an qui sont arrivés sur notre sol et y sont restés ! Et c’est l’immigration recensée et connue… Et c’est à Zemmour qu’on fait un procès pour xénophobie quand on devrait mettre aux arrêts nos gouvernants de l’UMPS qui nous mentent depuis des lustres ! Quant à leurs valets, ils ne méritent que le goudron et des plumes !",

When she got up to see what it was she found a needle sticking out of the seat with a note attached saying You have just been infected by HIV. The Disease Control Centre in Melbourne reports many similar incidents have occurred in many other Australian cities recently. All tested needles are HIV Positive. The Centre also reports that needles have been found in the cash dispensers in ATMs. We ask everyone to use extreme caution when faced with this kind of situation. All public chairs / seats should be inspected with vigilance and caution before use. Seventeen people have tested positive in the Western suburbs alone in the last 2 months!!! A careful visual inspection should be enough. In addition they ask that each of you pass this message along to all members of your family and your friends of the potential danger. We all have to be careful at public places! This is very important. Just think about saving a life of someone even you don't know by forwarding this message. Please, take a few seconds of your time to pass it along. Australian Red Cross Blood Service Ph: [REMOVED] Fax: [REMOVED] e-mail: [REMOVED] ",

Below is a good example of a discussion with a master of circular logic. Don't be logical, don't respect the truth or your adversary, just say what you think makes a new case when the previous case gets too difficult to defend. On the streets of downtown Houston, May 1, 2006.  Jim Moore reporting for a Houston TV station:  Jim: Juan, I see that you and thousands of other protesters are marching in the streets to demonstrate for your cause. Exactly what is your cause and what do you expect to accomplish by this protest?  Juan: We want our rights. We will show you how powerful we  are. We will bring Houston to its knees!  Jim: What rights?  Juan: Our right to live here...legally. Our right to get all the benefits you get.  Jim: When did you come to the United States?  Juan: Six years ago. I crossed over the border at night with seven other friends.  Jim: Why did you come?  Juan: For work. I can earn as much in a month as I could in a year in Mexico . Besides, I get free health care, our Mexican children can go to school free, if I lose my job I will get Welfare, and someday I will have the Social Security. Nothing like that in Mexico!  Jim: Did you feel badly about breaking our immigration laws when you came?  Juan: No! Why should I feel bad? I have a right to be here. I have a right to amnesty. I paid lots of money for my Social Security and Green Cards.  Jim: How did you acquire those documents?  Juan: >From a guy in Dallas . He charged me a lot of money too.  Jim: Did you know that those documents were forged?  Juan: It is of no matter. I have a right to be here and work.  Jim: What is the right you speak of?  Juan: The right of all Aliens. It is found in your Constitution. Read it!  Jim: I have read it, but I do not remember it saying anything about rights for Aliens.  Juan: It is in that part where it says that all men have Alien rights, like the right to pursue happiness. I wasn't happy in Mexico, so I came here.  Jim: I think you are referring to the declaration of Independence and that document speaks to unalienable rights ... Not Alien rights.  Juan: Whatever.  Jim: Since you are demanding to become an American citizen, why then are you carrying a Mexican Flag?  Juan: Because I am Mexican.  Jim: But you said you want to be given amnesty ... To become a US citizen.  Juan: No. This is not what we want. This is our country, a part of Mexico that you Gringos stole from us. We want it returned to its rightful owner.  Jim: Juan, you are standing in Texas. After winning the war with Mexico, Texas became a Republic, and later Texans voted to join the USA. It was not stolen from Mexico.  Juan: That is a Gringo lie. Texas was stolen. So was California, New Mexico and Arizona . It is just like all the other stuff you Gringos steal, like oil and babies. You are a country of thieves.  Jim: Babies? You think we steal babies?  Juan: Sure. Like from Korea and Vietnam and China . I see them all over the place. You let all these foreigners in, but try to keep us Mexicans out. How is this fair?  Jim: So, you really don't want to become an American citizen then.  Juan: I just want my rights! Everyone has a right to live, work, and speak their native language wherever and whenever they please. That's another thing we demand. All signs and official documents should be in Spanish. Teachers must teach in Spanish. Soon, more people here in Houston will speak Spanish than English. It is our right!  Jim: If I were to cross over the border into Mexico without proper documentation, what rights would I have there?  Juan: None. You would probably go to jail, but that's different.  Jim: How is it different? You said everyone has the right to live wherever they please.  Juan: You Gringos are a bunch of land grabbing thieves. Now you want Mexico too? Mexico has its rights. You Gringos have no rights in Mexico. Why would you want to go there anyway? There is no free medical service, schools, or welfare there for foreigners such as you. You cannot even own land in my country. Stay in the country of your birth.  Jim: I can see that there is no way that we can agree on this issue. Thank you for your comments.  Juan: Viva Mexico!",

Oscar Meyer replied , telling the Marines thank you for their support of their business, but that Oscar Meyer does not support the war, nor anyone in it, and that they would not send the troops their brand of hot dogs. So as not to offend Oscar Meyer, maybe we should not support them by buying any of their products! As a war vet writing to fellow patriots, I feel we should get this out in the open. I know this war might not be very popular with some folks, but that doesn't mean we don't support the boys on the ground fighting street-to-street and house-to-house for what they and I believe is right.

        "tweet": "New York State started a pilot program upstate north of Albany on the Northway to catch speeders using the Easy Pass system. Recording devices were installed at intervals along the highway. Once an Easy Pass equipped vehicle passes, the device registers the account number and the time. Same is again registered at the next check-point. Based upon the distance between the register points and the posted speed limit, the state is sending speeding tickets in the mail to the guilty persons.  Because every driver does not have Easy Pass, the State is perplexed as what to do to impose the system state-wide. The solution has been found. Soon all new vehicle registration stickers will have a metal strip or chip imbedded in same. This will take the place of the Easy Pass system as stated above. When a vehicle passes the registering device, the strip will relay all the information.  This is not fictional. New York State contracted with VERIZON to install the system. The system has already been installed and the entire Bronx River Parkway in Westchester County has been wired for when the new system begins. Once the State makes the new program public and advises all motorists of the potential for numerous speeding tickets, it will also reveal that the system has already been installed.  Another reason that will be given for the new system is to enable the authorities to track stolen vehicles, to trace kidnap victims, to monitor and trace suspected criminals and terrorists, etc.  BIG BROTHER IS ALIVE AND WELL.  Pass this along to every one you know.",

If running low, just get your gas the day before on April 14 or the day after on April 16. Every little bit helps.  In April 1997, there was a gas out conducted nationwide in protest of gas prices. Gasoline prices dropped 30 cents a gallon overnight.  On April 15th 2011, all internet users are to not go to a gas station in protest of high gas prices. Gas is now over $1.20 a liter/$3.87 is most places.  If all users did not go to the pump on the 15th, it would take $2,292,000,000.00 (that's almost 3 BILLION) out of the oil companies pockets for just one day, so please do not go to the gas station on April 15th and let's try to put a dent in the Middle Eastern oil industry for at least one day.   ",

OBAMA FINDS LEGAL WAY AROUND THE 2ND AMENDMENT AND USES IT. IF THIS PASSES, THERE COULD BE WAR  On Wednesday the Obama administration took its first major step in a plan to ban all firearms in the United States. The Obama administration intends to force gun control and a complete ban on all weapons for US citizens through the signing of international treaties with foreign nations. By signing international treaties on gun control, the Obama administration can use the US State Department to bypass the normal legislative process in Congress. Once the US Government signs these international treaties, all US citizens will be subject to those gun laws created by foreign governments. These are laws that have been developed and promoted by organizations such as the United Nations and individuals such as George Soros and Michael Bloomberg.  The laws are designed and intended to lead to the complete ban and confiscation of all firearms. The Obama administration is attempting to use tactics and methods of gun control that will inflict major damage to our 2nd Amendment before US citizens even understand what has happened.  Obama can appear before the public and tell them that he does not intend to pursue any legislation (United States) that will lead to new gun control laws, while cloaked in secrecy, his Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton is committing the US to international treaties and foreign gun control laws.  Does that mean Obama is telling the truth? What it means is that there will be no publicized gun control debates in the media or votes in Congress. We will wake up one morning and find that the United States has signed a treaty that prohibits firearm and ammunition manufacturers from selling to the public. We will wake up another morning and find that the US has signed a treaty that prohibits any transfer of firearm ownership. And then, we will wake up yet another morning and find that the US has signed a treaty that requires US citizens to deliver any firearm they own to the local government collection and destruction center or face imprisonment. This has happened in other countries, past and present!  THIS IS NOT A JOKE OR A FALSE WARNING.  As sure as government health care will be forced on us by the Obama administration through whatever means necessary, so will gun control.  Read the article: http://www.reuters.com/article/politicsNews/idUSTRE59E0Q920091015 Please forward this message to others who may be concerned about the direction in which our country is headed.

A cela, deux raisons : la première trouve son origine dans la lâcheté des institutions et de ses représentants, conditionnés par le politiquement correct , la seconde en est la conséquence directe : le sentiment d’impunité des nouveaux venus. Ainsi est-ce aux européens de s’adapter et de baisser les yeux… Un juge de Messine, en Italie, a condamné trois jeunes filles à payer une amende de 2.582 € chacune pour avoir porté un maillot deux pièces sur une plage privée de la très touristique ville de Taormine (Sicile), fréquentée par quelques familles musulmanes en vacances et originaires d’Arabie Saoudite. Extrait de la sentence : « Au regard de la loi sont considérés obscènes les actes et les objets qui, selon le sentiment commun, heurtent la pudeur (c.p. 725, 726). » La pudeur, sentiment de honte, de privation ou de répulsion, est caractérisée devant les manifestations ne correspondant pas à la propre éducation et culture d’autrui et considérées comme scandaleuses pour sa propre éducation sexuelle. L’obscène serait ainsi la conséquence d’absence de pudeur, comme on le déduit de l’article 527 du code pénal. Il est important de souligner que l’idée d’obscène et le sens commun de la pudeur se modifient non seulement au cours du temps, mais changent d’une société à l’autre. La compréhension de ces idées renvoie à la considération du corps et de la sexualité. Les jeunes filles étaient les seules femmes à utiliser une tenue semblable et étaient conscientes que toutes les femmes présentes portaient un costume de bain qui recouvrait intégralement leur corps y compris les bras et les jambes. Il est aussi mentionné que le responsable du tour operator saoudien, Dr. Chokri Majouli, avait plusieurs fois sollicité, sur demande des parents musulmans présents, les jeunes filles à ne se pas se présenter sur la plage avec cette tenue qui laissait apercevoir leurs caractéristiques féminines aux garçons présents qui, ayant reçu une éducation musulmane religieuse, étaient désorientés et stupéfaits. Il avait aussi expliqué que dans leur culture, une semblable manière de s’habiller était typique de femmes exerçant la prostitution en maisons privées et qu’il n’avait reçu que des réponses offensantes de la part des prévenues. La pseudo domination de l’islam sur le sol européen n’est faite que de la lâcheté des élites qui nous gouvernent, et qu’il faut remplacer de toute urgence. Source : Corriere del Mattino",

During your campaign, Americans watched as you made mockery of our tradition of standing and crossing your heart when the Pledge of Allegiance was spoken. You, out of four people on the stage, were the only one not honoring our tradition.  YES, We noticed.  During one of your many speeches, Americans heard you say that you intended to visit all 57 states. We all know that Islam, not America has 57 states. YES, We noticed.  When President Bush leaned over at Ground Zero and gently placed a flower on the memorial, while you nonchalantly tossed your flower onto the pile without leaning over.  YES, We noticed.  Every time you apologized to other countries for America's position on an issue we have wondered why you don't share our pride in this great country. When you have heard foreign leaders berate our country and our beliefs, you have not defended us. In fact, you insulted the British Crown beyond belief.  YES, We noticed.  When your pastor of 20 years, God-damned America and said that 9/11 was America's chickens coming home to roost and you denied having heard recriminations of that nature, we wondered how that could be. You later disassociated yourself from that church and  Pastor Wright because it was politically expedient to do so.  YES, We noticed.  When you announced that you would transform America, we wondered why. With all her faults, America is the greatest country on earth. Sir, KEEP THIS IN MIND, if not for America and the people who built her, you wouldn't be sitting in the White House now. Prior to your election to the highest office in this Country, you were a senator from Illinois and from what we can glean from the records available, not a very remarkable one.  YES, We noticed.  All through your campaign and even now, you have surrounded yourself with individuals who are basically unqualified for the positions for which you appointed them. Worse than that, the majority of them are people who, like you, bear no special allegiance, respect, or affection for this country and her traditions.  YES, We noticed.  You are seven months into your term and every morning millions of Americans wake up to a new horror heaped on us by you. You seek to saddle working Americans with a health care/insurance reform package that, along with cap and trade, will bankrupt this nation.  YES, We noticed.  We seek, by protesting, to let our representatives know that we are not in favor of these crippling expenditures and we are labeled un-American, racist, mob. We wonder how we are supposed to let you know how frustrated we are. You have attempted to make our protests seem isolated and insignificant. Until your appointment, Americans had the right to speak out.  YES, We noticed.  On September 11, 2001 there were no Republicans or Democrats, only Americans. And we all grieved together and helped each other in whatever way we could. The attack on 9/11 was carried out because we are Americans.  And YES, We noticed.  There were many of us who prayed that as a black president you could help unite this nation. In seven months you have done more to destroy this nation than the attack on 9/11. You have failed us.  YES, We noticed.  September 11 is a day of remembrance for all Americans. You propose to make 9/11 a National Service Day. While we know that you don't share our reverence for 9/11, we pray that history will report your proposal as what it is...a disgrace.  YES, We noticed.  You have made a mockery of our Constitution and the office that you hold. You have embarrassed and slighted us in foreign visits and policy.  YES, We noticed..  We have noticed all these things. We will deal with you. When Americans come together again, it will be to remove you from office.  Take notice.  If you agree with this please pass it on.",

They are the ones who were behind the recent Presidential election chaos here. Thousands of people have been displaced by election violence (over 350,000) and I don't know the last count of the dead. Obama under friends of Obama gave almost a million dollars to the opposition campaign who just happened to be his cousin, Raila Odinga, who is a socialist trained in east Germany. He has been trying to bring Kenya down for years and the last president threw him in prison for trying to subvert this country! December 27th elections brought cries from ODM (Odinga Camp) of rigged election. Obama and Raila speak daily. As we watch Obama rise in the US we are sure that whatever happens, he will use the same tactic, crying rigged election if he doesn't win and possibly cause a race war in America.  What we would like you to know is what the American press has been keeping a dirty little secret. Obama IS a Muslim and he IS a racist and this is a fulfillment of the 911 threat that was just the beginning. Jihad is the only true Muslim way. We have been working with them for 20 years this July! He is not an American as we know it. Please encourage your friends and associates not to be taken in by those that are promoting him. It is world wide jihad. All our friends in Europe are very disturbed by the Muslim infiltration into their countries. By the way. His true name is Barak Hussein Muhammed Obama. Won't that sound sweet to our enemies as they swear him in on the Koran!  God Bless you.  Pray for us here in Kenya. We are still fighting for our nation to withstand the same kind of assault that every nation, including America, is fighting. Takeover from the outside to fit the new world order. As believers, this means we will be the first targets. Here in Kenya, not one mosque was burned down, but hundreds of churches were burned down, some with people in them, burned alive.  Jesus Christ is our peace but the new world order of Globalism has infiltrated the church and confused believers into thinking that they can compromise and survive. (Jimmy Carter?) It won't be so. I will send you a newsletter we sent out in February documenting in a more cohesive manner what I've tried to say in a few paragraphs.

You've probably read that some of the Sept. 11 relief money was granted to an organization defending people suspected of involvement in the very crimes that made these charitable efforts necessary. The offending organization, the September 11th Fund, was established by the United Way and the New York Community Trust to receive and distribute donations to help victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.  We're not talking about pocket change here. The Fund gave $171,000 to the Legal Aid Society, which is assisting in the legal defense of eight terror suspects now detained in Brooklyn, N.Y. That's like the Heart Association donating to the Society of Sedentary Butter Eaters. Actually, it's worse, because sedentary butter-eaters harm themselves . . . they don't murder innocent people.  Are you outraged yet? If not, there's more. The Fund, far from chastened by criticism from those outraged at the above, is up to further mischief.  CNSNews.com now tells us that the Fund has made more than a million dollars worth of grants to various left-wing political groups — CNSNews' characterization, not mine, but it is undeniably correct.",

When she stood up to see what it was, a needle was found poking through the seat with an attached note saying, you have been infected with HIV. The Centres for Disease Control in Birmingham, reports similar events have taken place in several other cities recently. ALL of the needles tested HAVE been found positive for HIV. The CDC also reports that needles have been found in the coin return areas of pay phones and coke machines. Everyone is asked to use extreme caution when confronted with these types of situations. All public chairs should be thoroughly but safely inspected prior to any use. A thorough visual inspection is considered the bare minimum. Further more, they ask that everyone notify their family members and friends of the potential dangers, as well.

        "tweet": "Of all tales of the supernatural, this one is perhaps the best documented, the most disturbing and the most difficult to explain . . . The Princess of Amen-Ra lived some 1,500 years before Christ. When she died, she was laid in an ornate wooden coffin and buried deep in a vault at Luxor, on the banks of the Nile.  In the late 1890s, 4 rich young Englishmen visiting the excavations at Luxor were invited to buy an exquisitely fashioned mummy case containing the remains of Princess of Amen-Ra. They drew lots. The man who won paid several thousand pounds and had the coffin taken to his hotel. A few hours later, he was seen walking out towards the desert. He never returned.  The next day, one of the remaining 3 men was shot by an Egyptian servant accidentally. His arm was so severely wounded it had to be amputated.  The third man in the foursome found on his return home that the bank holding his entire savings had failed. The fourth guy suffered a severe illness, lost his job and was reduced to selling matches in the street.  Nevertheless, the coffin reached England (causing other misfortunes along the way), where it was bought by a London businessman.  After 3 of his family members had been injured in a road accident and his house damaged by fire, the businessman donated it to the British Museum.  As the coffin was being unloaded from a truck in the museum courtyard, the truck suddenly went into reverse and trapped a passerby. Then as the casket was being lifted up the stairs by 2 workmen, 1 fell and broke his leg. The other, apparently in perfect health, died unaccountably two days later.  Once the Princess was installed in the Egyptian Room, trouble really started. The Museum's night watchmen frequently heard frantic hammering and sobbing from the coffin. Other exhibits in the room were also often hurled about at night. One watchman died on duty making the other watchmen wanting to quit. Cleaners refused to go near the Princess too. When a visitor derisively flicked a dustcloth at the face painted on the coffin, his child died of measles soon afterwards.  Finally, the authorities had the mummy carried down to the basement figuring it could not do any harm down there. Within a wk, one of the helpers was seriously ill, and the supervisor of the move was found dead on his desk.  By now, the papers had heard of it. A journalist photographer took a picture of the mummy case and when he developed it, the painting on the coffin was of a horrifying, human face. The photographer was said to have gone home then, locked his bedroom door and shot himself.  Soon afterwards, the museum sold the mummy to a private collector. After continual misfortune (and deaths), the owner banished it to the attic.  A well known authority on the occult, Madame Helena Blavatsky, visited the premises. Upon entry, she was sized with a shivering fit and searched the house for the source of an evil influence of incredible intensity She finally came to the attic and found the mummy case.  Can you exorcise this evil spirit? Asked the owner. There is no such thing as exorcism. Evil remains evil forever. Nothing can be done about it. I implore you to get rid of this evil as soon as possible.  But no British museum would take the mummy the fact that almost 20 people had met with misfortune, disaster or death from handling the casket, in barely 10 years, was now well known.  Eventually, a hardheaded American archaeologist (who dismissed the happenings as quirks of circumstance), paid a handsome price for the mummy and arranged for its removal to New York. In Apr 1912, the new owner escorted its treasure aboard a sparkling, new White Star liner about to make its maiden voyage to New York.  On the night of April 14, amid scenes of unprecedented horror, the Princess of Amen-Ra accompanied 1,500 passengers to their deaths at the bottom of the Atlantic. The name of the ship was of course, the H.M.S. TITANIC [sic].",

She was halfway through with her sandwich when she noticed an extra clump of mayonnaise on the side of the bun. She licked it off, tasted it and immediately realized things were not right. I'm not gonna lie, McDowell said. On Birthdays and holidays I give my man a little something extra in the bedroom, you know? So when I licked the mayo off of the bun, the texture was familiar.  McDowell immediately called over the manager who denied the allegations, so she contacted the local health department. They sent the mayo remains off for testing and the results were positive for 2 different types of semen. To make matters worse, in the following days, McDowell woke with a giant red rash on the corner of her mouth. The rash spread and developed into severe blisters. The doctor was able to verify that she had contracted the herpes virus, which she claims was a result of her tainted McChicken. The manager confirmed that two employees were fired as a result of her allegations and the positive semen test results. The manager of the McDonald’s also added, We can't always keep an eye on our employee's conduct. We can only hope, during the interview process, that we are able to hire employees that meet our companies standards.   ",

Important message from Crime Stoppers, please read...  While driving on a rural end of the roadway on Thursday morning, I saw an infant car seat on the side of the road with a blanket draped over it. For whatever reason, I did not stop, even though I had all kinds of thoughts running through my head. But when I got to my destination, I called the Police and they were going to check it out. But, this is what the Police advised even before they went out there to check.... There are several things to be aware of ... gangs and thieves are now plotting different ways to get a person (mostly women)to stop their vehicle and get out of the car. There is a gang initiation reported by the local Police where gangs are placing a car seat by the road...with a fake baby in it...waiting for a woman, of course, to stop and check on the abandoned baby. Note that the location of this car seat is usually beside a wooded or grassy (field) area and the person -- woman -- will be dragged into the woods, beaten and raped, and usually left for dead. If it's a man, they're usually beaten and robbed and maybe left for dead, too. DO NOT STOP FOR ANY REASON!!! DIAL 9-9-9 AND REPORT WHAT YOU SAW, BUT DON'T EVEN SLOW DOWN. IF YOU ARE DRIVING AT NIGHT AND EGGS ARE THROWN AT YOUR WINDSCREEN,DO NOT STOP TO CHECK THE CAR,DO NOT OPERATE THE WIPER AND DO NOT SPRAY ANY WATER BECAUSE EGGS MIXED WITH WATER BECOME MILKY AND BLOCK YOUR VISION UP TO 92.5%, AND YOU ARE THEN FORCED TO STOP BESIDE THE ROAD AND BECOME A VICTIM OF THESE CRIMINALS. THIS IS A NEW TECHNIQUE USED BY GANGS, SO PLEASE INFORM YOUR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES. THESE ARE DESPERATE TIMES AND THESE ARE UNSAVOURY INDIVIDUALS WHO WILL TAKE DESPERATE MEASURES TO GET WHAT THEY WANT. Please talk to your loved ones about this. This is a new tactic used. Please be safe. Get started NOW -- SEND THIS MESSAGE TO ALL YOUR FRIENDS AND LOVED ONES TO BE CAREFUL AND AWARE OF EVERYTHING AROUND THEM SO AS NOT TO BECOME A VICTIM.",

Somewhere between his home and the stadium, Cal realized that he had left something back at his house, and turned back to retrieve it. Upon arriving at his home, he found Kevin Costner in bed with his wife, Kelly. Cal then proceeded to beat the crap out of Costner, to the point that Costner was unable to make any publicity opportunities for a time. Cal then called the Orioles, and told them he wouldn't be coming in to play that day. Upon hearing this, the owner reminded Cal about his streak, telling him The Streak would end if he didn't play that day. Cal told him it was impossible for him to come in, so there went the streak. Reportedly, the owner told him not to worry, because he would take care of it. That night, the game was cancelled due to electrical failure with some lights on the field. The caller [I heard this rumor from] said that there was no problem with the lights, that everything else, including the hotels and restaurants that are part of Camden Yards, worked perfectly. The next day, the lights were fixed, Cal was able to play, and the streak stayed intact.",

Then, if you choose to buy it, at least you're doing so with your eyes open.  RAPE IN A DIFFERENT GUISE  Dear Editors  Recently I bought a cooking oil that's new to our supermarkets, Canola Oil. I tried it because the label assured me it was lowest in bad fats. However, when I had used half the bottle, I concluded that the label told me surprisingly little else and I started to wonder: where does canola oil come from? Olive oil comes from olives, peanut oil from peanuts, sunflower oil from sunflowers but what is a canola? There was nothing on the label to enlighten me, which I thought odd. So, I did some investigating on the Internet.  There are plenty of official Canola sites lauding this new wonder oil with all its low-fat health benefits. It takes a little longer to find sites that tell the less palatable details.  Here are just a few facts everyone should know before buying anything containing canola. Canola is not the name of a natural plant but a made-up word, from the words Canada and oil. Canola is a genetically engineered plant developed in Canada from the Rapeseed Plant, which is part of the mustard family of plants. According to AgriAlternatives, The Online Innovation, and Technology Magazine for Farmers, By nature, these rapeseed oils, which have long been used to produce oils for industrial purposes, are... toxic to humans and other animals. (This, by the way, is one of the websites singing the praises of the new canola industry.)  Rapeseed oil is poisonous to living things and is an excellent insect repellent. I have been using it (in very diluted form, as per instructions) to kill the aphids on my roses for the last two years. It works very well it suffocates them. Ask for it at your nursery. Rape is an oil that is used as a lubricant, fuel, soap and synthetic rubber base and as a illuminate for color pages in magazines. It is an industrial oil. It is not a food. Rape oil, it seems, causes emphysema, respiratory distress, anemia, constipation, irritability, and blindness in animals and humans.  Rape oil was widely used in animal feeds in England and Europe between 1986 and 1991, when it was thrown out. Remember the Mad Cow disease scare, when millions of cattle in the UK were slaughtered in case of infecting humans? Cattle were being fed on a mixture containing material from dead sheep, and sheep suffer from a disease called scrapie. It was thought this was how Mad Cow began and started to infiltrate the human chain. What is interesting is that when rape oil was removed from animal feed, 'scrapie' disappeared.  We also haven't seen any further reports of Mad Cow since rape oil was removed from the feed. Perhaps not scientifically proven, but interesting all the same. US and Canadian farmers grow genetically engineered rapeseed and manufacturers use its oil (canola) in thousands of processed foods, with the blessings of Canadian and US government watchdog agencies. The canola supporting websites say that canola is safe to use. They admit it was developed from the rapeseed, but insist that through genetic engineering it is no longer rapeseed, but canola instead.  Except canola means Canadian oil and the plant is still a rape plant, albeit genetically modified. The new name provides perfect cover for commercial interests wanting to make millions. Look at the ingredients list on labels. Apparently peanut oil is being replaced with rape oil. You'll find it in an alarming number of processed foods. There's more, but to conclude: rape oil was the source of the chemical warfare agent mustard gas, which was banned after blistering the lungs and skins of hundred of thousands of soldiers and civilians during W.W.I. Recent French reports indicate that it was again in use during the Gulf War.  Check products for ingredients. If the label says, may contain the following and lists canola oil, you know it contains canola oil because it is the cheapest oil and the Canadian government subsidizes it to industries involved in food processing.  I don't know what you'll be cooking with tonight, but I'll be using olive oil and old-fashioned butter, from a genetically unmodified cow.  Here is more information....  Canola oil from the rape seed, referred to as the Canadian oil because Canada is mainly responsible for it being marketed in the USA. The Canadian government and industry paid our Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) $50 million dollars to have canola oil placed on the (GRAS) List, Generally Recognized As Safe. Thus a new industry was created. Laws were enacted affecting international trade, commerce, and traditional diets. Studies with lab. animals were disastrous. Rats developed fatty degeneration of heart, kidney, adrenals, and thyroid gland. When canola oil was withdrawn from their diets, the deposits dissolved but scar tissue remained on all vital organs. No studies on humans were made before money was spent to promote Canola oil in the USA.  Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a rare fatal degenerative disease caused by a build up long-chain fatty acids (c22 to c28) which destroys the myelin (protective sheath) of the nerves. Canola oil is a very long chain fatty acid oil (c22). Those who will defend canola oil say that the Chinese and Indians have used it for centuries with no effect, however it was in an unrefined form (taken from FATS THAT HEAL AND FATS THAT KILL by Udo Erasmus).  My cholesterol level was 150. After a year using Canola oil I tested 260. I switched back to pure olive oil and it has taken 5 years to get it down to 160. Thus began this project to find answers since most Doctors will say that Canola oil is O.K.  My sister spilled Canola oil on a piece of fabric, after 5 pre-treatings and harsh washings, the oil spot still showed. She stopped using Canola oil, wondering what it did to our insides if it could not be removed from cloth easily.  Our Father bred birds, always checking labels to insure there was no rape seed in their food. He said, The birds will eat it, but they do not live very long.  A friend, who worked for only 9 mo. as a quality control taster at an apple-chip factory where Canola oil was used exclusively for frying, developed numerous health problems. These included loose teeth & gum disease numb hands and feet swollen arms and legs upon rising in the morning extreme joint pain especially in hands, cloudy vision, constipation with stools like black marbles, hearing loss skin tears from being bumped lack of energy hair loss and heart pains. It has been five years since she has worked there and still has some joint pain, gum disease, and numbness.  A fellow worker, about 30 years old, who ate very little product, had a routine check up and found that his blood vessels were like those of an 80 year old man. Two employees fed the waste product to baby calves and their hair fell out. After removing the fried apple chips from the diet their hair grew back in.  My daughter and her girls were telling jokes. Stephanie hit her mom's arm with the back of a butter knife in a gesture, Oh mom not hard enough to hurt. My daughters arm split open like it was rotten. She called me to ask what could have caused it. I said, I'll bet anything that you are using Canola oil. Sure enough, there was a big gallon jug in the pantry.  Rape seed oil is a penetrating oil, to be used in light industry, not for human consumption. It contains a toxic substance. Even after the processing to reduce the erucic acid content, it is still a penetrating oil. We have found that it turns rancid very fast. Also it leaves a residual rancid odor on clothing.  Rape seed oil used for stir-frying in China found to emit cancer causing chemicals. (Rapeseed oil smoke causes lung cancer) Amal Kumar Maj. The Wall Street JournaL June 7, 1995 pB6(W) pB6 (E) col 1 (11 col in). Compiled by Darleen Bradley.  Canola oil is a health hazard to use as a cooking oil or salad oil. It is not the healthy oil we thought it was. It is not fit for human consumption, do not eat canola oil, it can hurt you. Polyunsaturated or not, this is a bad oil.

Where did the word CHAD come from? According to one theory, back in the days when people used key punches, those little bits of paper decorated office carpets every where until an inventor named Mr. Chadless patented a machine he called the Chadless Keypunch. His machine moved office technology forward by eliminating the little bits of paper created by the keypunch process. Mr. Chadless clearly assumed that by naming the machine after himself he might gain him the same immortality enjoyed by Mr. Ford and Mssrs. Smith and Wesson. No doubt Mr. Chadless' invaluable contribution to society was appreciated by building maintenance crews everywhere. However, his name was soon forgotten because the users of his technology made the mistaken assumption that the Chadless Keypunch was so called for the benefit of providing keypunch operation without chad. By such historical accidents does our lexicon evolve.",

I was only 14 back then but was surprised by this particular clip. There was Olie in front of God and Country getting the third degree. But what he said stunned me. He was being drilled by some senator I didn't recognize who asked him:  'Did you not recently spend close to $60,000 for a home security system?'  Oliver replied, 'Yes I did sir.'  The senator continued, trying to get a laugh out of the audience, 'Isn't this just a little excessive?'  'No sir,' continued Oliver.  'No. And why not?'  'Because the life of my family and I were threatened.'  'Threatened? By who.'  'By a terrorist, sir.'  'Terrorist? What terrorist could possibly scare you that much?'  'His name is Osama bin Laden.'  At this point the senator tried to repeat the name, but couldn't pronounce it, which most people back then probably couldn't. A couple of people laughed at the attempt. Then the senator continued.  'Why are you so afraid of this man?'  'Because sir, he is the most evil person alive that I know of.'  'And what do you recommend we do about him?'  'If it were me I would recommend an assassin team be formed to eliminate him and his men from the face of the earth.'  The senator disagreed with this approach and that was all they showed of the clip.  It's scary when you think 15 years ago the government was aware of Osama bin Laden and his potential threat to the security of the world. I guess like all great tyrants they start small but if left untended spread like the virus they truly are.",

Robin Williams' plan...(Hard to argue with this logic!)  I see a lot of people yelling for peace but I have not heard of one plan for peace. Books, not Bombs won't work. The head mullahs won't let anyone read them. If they do, they poke their eyes out.  Here's the plan:  1) The US will apologize to the world for our interference in their affairs, past & present. You know, Hitler, Mussolini and the rest of them 'good old boys'. We will never interfere again.  2) We will withdraw our troops from all over the world, starting with Germany, South Korea and the Philippines. They don't want us there. We would station troops at our borders. No more sneaking through holes in the fence.  3) All illegal aliens have 90 days to get their affairs together and leave. We'll give them a free trip home. After 90 days the remainder will be gathered up and deported immediately, regardless of who or where they are. France would welcome them.  4) All future visitors will be thoroughly checked and limited to 90 days unless given a special permit. No one from a terrorist  nation would be allowed in. If you don't like it there, change it yourself, don't hide here. Asylum would not ever be available to anyone. We don't need any more cab drivers.  5) No students over age 21. The older ones are the bombers. If they don't attend classes, they get a D and it's back home baby.  6) The US will make a strong effort to become self sufficient energy wise. This will include developing non-polluting sources of energy but will require a temporary drilling of oil in the Alaskan wilderness. The caribou will have to cope for a while.  7) Offer Saudi Arabia and other oil producing countries $10 a barrel for their oil. If they don't like it, we go someplace else.  8) If there is a famine or other natural catastrophe in the world, we will not interfere. They can pray to Allah or whomever, for seeds, rain, cement or whatever they need. Besides most of what we give them is stolen or given to the army. The people who need it most get very little, if any anyway.  9) Ship the UN Headquarters to an island some place. We don't need the spies and fair weather friends here. Besides, it would make a good homeless shelter or lockup for illegal aliens.  10) All Americans must go to charm and beauty school. That way, no one can call us Ugly Americans any longer.  Now, ain't that a winner of a plan?",

Just a few short days ago, he had an interview with the Wall Street Journal to further discuss his economic plans/policies for the future and he spelled it out quite clearly. As you can see from the excerpt quote from that interview (below), he plans on officially doing away with capitalism and replacing it with his much favored system of socialism. Many of us already knew of his strong socialist tendencies in the past, but he has now put it out there officially on record. It is amazing that this article, and specifically this quote, is getting overlooked, especially when he is so direct and brazen about his plans. Every single American who works for a living should be absolutely scared spitless. Pass this along to everyone you can.  Quote from Wall Street Journal:  a strong government hand is needed to assure that wealth is distributed more equitably.

He informed that on the day of the election there will be undercover officers to execute warrants on those who come to vote based on the anticipated turnout. He advised me if I had any outstanding warrants or traffic offenses I should clear them up prior to voting. They assume this to be an opportunity for those who normally go by fake names and addresses, to give their real names and id's. Allowing them to place name and face together and walla, gotcha! Arrested on the spot. So if you have one or the other take care of it.  Due to the electronic genius of wireless technology this can and will take place all around the nation from LA to New York. Why hasn't this been done before? This seems to be a great way to arrest of just be able to identify criminals in the area. I applaud the new efforts of local and state authorities and hope to see a great success rate. I'm sorry to say but I don't think they should be able to vote anyway! Question? Are convicted felons allowed to vote?  He also said that both Obama and McCain support this idea but that he, Obama, does not want the public to see any of his supporters get locked up showing their support or illegally voting for him. An incentive to avoid the legal dilemmas, but still participate in the vote is being put in place. This would allow individuals to turn themselves in, prior to voting, without legal penalty. This type of incentive recently took place at a South Philadelphia church with an outstanding turnout. Is this taking away from the true freedom of voting? Is this legal?  He had also learned that at the polling sites local authorites will not only be checking for scoff law traffic ticket offenders inside, but this will also take place outside. There will be vehicles equipped with plate identification computers. Upon identification cars will be locked with an immobilization feature locked to its tire then towed.  I think this November will be a November to remember. I love technology.  Anonymous",

Albert Jex on the door. The owners' response was to place the flier on the dumpster where the rest of our soldiers belong.  For those of you who do not know, Albert Jex, 23, is the first Lockport native killed in the war in Iraq. He was one of four soldiers who died of wounds suffered when an explosive device blew up near their vehicle on Feb. 9 in Mosul, Iraq. Albert was assigned to the 3rd Battalion, 8th Cavalry Regiment, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division, Fort Hood, Texas. (US&J)  I'm obviously offended by this, being a soldier from a military family and all.  I know this is America, and these people have the right to object to such a request, but to go a step further and degrade American heroes is unnecessary. If you think so little of those who fight for our rights, you do not deserve to live here under the protection of those rights.  Also, the thing that makes me so mad about this is the fact that these people are not Americans. If you have been to this establishment, you will have noticed their ethnicity. I was never bothered by that until now. I am sure they would welcome his money, my money, any Americans money.  Why then does his service to this Country, whose money they want so badly, disgust them? Why then can’t a piece of paper with a fallen soldiers picture on it be placed on their door? If they feel this way about one American, what are the odds that they feel this way about all Americans? Being a business in this community, wouldn't you think that they would welcome something as petty as a flier to display in honor of someone from our community?  If you agree with this pass it on, and boycott the Lockport Dunkin Doughnuts. That is all I have to say. I am not sorry if my opinions offended any of you.  **I knew I didn't like that Dunkin Donuts! The disgusting part is the owners are locals! They seem to have no problem handing out their coupons for their nasty coffee at the kids street hockey games and soccer.. Shame on them!

She suffered from a fractured jaw and multiple concussions to the head and the Deputy Sheriff advised her mother to re-think her wanting to file charges against the football player because her daughter pushed him back. The school ended up documenting assault charges on the victims school file, NOT the football players!!! To make things worse, the Deputy Sheriff warned the victim, by saying, Just so you know, if you file charges against him, I'm taking his side.

As I read the following, my heart sank. I urge each and every one of you to pass this on to as many people as you can. I cannot stress how important this is! This is very disturbing news. In addition to the following true story, I will also add that my own sons were playing in the ball pit at Discovery Zone one day. One son lost his watch, and was very upset. We dug and dug in those balls, trying to find the watch. Instead, we found vomit, food, faeces, and other stuff I do not want to discuss. I went to the manager and raised heck. Came to find out, the ball pit is only cleaned out once a month. I have doubts that it is even done that often. My kids will never play in another ball pit. Now read this  Hi, My name is Lauren Archer, my son Kevin and I lived in Sugarland, TX. On October 2nd, 1994 I took my only son to McDonald's for his 3rd birthday. After he finished lunch, I allowed him to play in the ball pit. When he started whining later on, I asked him what was wrong, he pointed to the back of his pull-up and simply said Mommy, it hurts. But I couldn't find anything wrong with him at that time. I bathed him when we got home, and it was at that point when I found a welt on his left buttock. Upon investigating, it seemed as if there was something like a splinter under the welt. I made an appointment to have it taken out the next day, but soon he started vomiting and shaking, then his eyes rolled back into his head.  From there, we went to the emergency room. He died later that night. It turned out that the welt on his buttock was the tip of a hypodermic needle that had broken off inside. The autopsy revealed that Kevin had died from heroine overdose. The next week, the police removed the balls from the ball pit and lo and behold. There was rotten food, several hypodermic needles: some full some used knives, half-eaten candy, diapers, feces, and the stench of urine. If a child is not safe in a child's play area then where? You can find the article on Kevin Archer in the October 10, 1994 issue of the Houston Chronicle. Please forward this to all loving mothers!",

Before Lorraine went shopping Monday I showed her this email. She looked at the products in the shop mentioned and they had the symbol hidden on the back of the packaging and in a very weak colour that was hard to see. Leggo's Pasta Sauce has the logo on their bottles. .. Have you ever seen this symbol on your food products? The LHS symbol is that of the - HALAL CERTIFICATION AUTHORITY AUSTRALIA This is a Muslim Association that collects money from the Australian Food Industry for this symbol so that Muslims will purchase the product. Yet we are told the Muslim population are only one and a half percent of Australia's total! On a recent radio talk-back show a well known host was alerted to this practice. He hit a stone wall when trying to find out HOW MUCH money was paid to this organization and WHERE the money went.  It was explained that by buying those marked products at least you are supporting a religion that is actively trying to destroy the Australian way of life or at the other extreme the money MAY be supporting terrorism. Many Australian Companies are paying this money including BEGA, CADBURY and many other well known companies. Check before you buy. DO YOU KNOW WHERE THAT MONEY IS GOING?

        "tweet": "I would like to know if the following email attributed to Charles Krauthammer has been correctly attributed. Circulated under the subject line: Health Care Decision: From Charles Krauthammer.     To all my friends, particularly those conservatives who are despondent over the searing betrayal by Chief Justice John Roberts and the pending demise of our beloved country, I offer this perspective to convey some profound hope and evidence of the Almighty's hand in the affairs of men in relation to the Supreme Court's decision on Obamacare.  I initially thought we had cause for despondency when I only heard the results of the decision and not the reason or the make-up of the sides. I have now read a large portion of the decision and I believe that it was precisely the result that Scalia, Alito, Thomas, Roberts and even Kennedy wanted and not a defeat for conservatism or the rule of law. I believe the conservatives on the court have run circles around the liberals and demonstrated that the libs are patently unqualified to be on the Supreme Court. Let me explain.  First let me assure you that John Roberts is a conservative and he is not dumb, mentally unstable, diabolical, a turncoat, a Souter or even just trying to be too nice. He is a genius along with the members of the Court in the dissent. The more of the decision I read the more remarkable it became. It is not obvious and it requires a passable understanding of Constitutional law but if it is explained anyone can see the beauty of it.  The decision was going to be a 5-4 decision no matter what, so the allegation that the decision was a partisan political decision was going to be made by the losing side and their supporters. If the bill was struck down completely with Roberts on the other side there would have been a national and media backlash against conservatives and probably strong motivation for Obama supporters to come out and vote in November. With today's decision that dynamic is reversed and there is a groundswell of support for Romney and Republicans, even for people who were formerly lukewarm toward Romney before today, additionally Romney raised more than 3 million dollars today.  Next, merely striking the law without the support of Democrats and libs would have left the fight over the commerce clause and the necessary and proper clause and the federal government's role in general festering and heading the wrong way as it has since 1942. As a result of the decision the libs are saying great things about Roberts how wise, fair and reasonable he is. They would never have said that without this decision even after the Arizona immigration decision on Monday. In the future when Roberts rules conservatively it will be harder for the left and the media to complain about the Roberts' Court's fairness. That's why he as Chief Justice went to the other side for this decision not Scalia, Alito, Thomas or Kennedy, all of whom I believe would have been willing to do it.  Next let's look at the decision itself. Thankfully Roberts got to write it as Chief Justice and it is a masterpiece. (As I write this the libs don't even know what has happened they just think Roberts is great and that they won and we are all going to have free, unlimited healthcare services and we are all going to live happily ever after.) He first emphatically states that Obamacare is unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause saying you cannot make people buy stuff. Then he emphatically states that it is unconstitutional under the necessary and proper clause which only applies to enumerated powers in the US Constitution. Justices Ginsberg, Breyer, Sotomayor and Kagan all went along with these statements. They never would have gone along with that sentiment if that was the basis for striking the law in total. This is huge because this means that the Court ruled 9-0 that Obamacare was unconstitutional under the Commerce clause which was Obama's whole defense of the bill. They also ruled 9-0 on the necessary and proper clause. Even better both of these rulings were unnecessary to the decision so it is gravy that we got the libs to concede this and it will make it easier to pare away at both theories in the future, which we must do. Well done.  Roberts, through very tortured reasoning, goes on to find that the taxing law provides the Constitutionality for the law. Virtually everyone agrees that the Federal government has the power to do this as it does with the mortgage deduction for federal income taxes. This too is huge because Obama assiduously avoided using the term tax and now he has to admit this law is a tax and it is on everyone even the poor. That will hurt him hugely in the polls and will help Romney. More importantly though is the fact that this makes this a budgetary issue that can be voted on in the Senate by a mere majority instead of 60 votes needed to stop a filibuster. That means that if the Republicans can gain a majority in the Senate, it can vote to repeal Obamacare in total.  Finally the Court voted 7-2 to strike down the punitive rules that take away money from states that do not expand Medicare as required in Obamacare. This too is huge because we got Kagan and Breyer to join this decision and it can easily be applied to many other cases of extortion the Federal government uses to force states to do things they don't want to. This is also amazing because Obamacare has no severability clause so by striking the Medicaid mandate portion as unconstitutional the whole bill should have been struck. If that happened none of these other benefits would have been accomplished. I haven't read far enough to know how he did it but I am sure it is brilliant.  So to recap the Roberts court through a brilliant tactical maneuver has: strengthened the limitations of the commerce clause and the necessary and proper clause by a unanimous decision, made Obama raise taxes on the poor and middle classes, converted Obamacare into a tax program repealable with 51 votes in the Senate, enhanced Romney’s and Republicans' fundraising and likelihood of being elected in November, weakened federal extortion and got the left to love Roberts and sing his praises all without anyone even noticing. Even Obama is now espousing the rule of law just two weeks after violating it with his deportation executive order.  That is why I have decided this was a genius decision and that I did in fact get a great birthday present today not to mention U. S. Attorney General Eric Holder being held in contempt. What a day.",

The small print lists a host of ingredients and among them is Glucuronolactone, an artificially manufactured stimulant developed in the early 60's by the American Government.  Glucuronolactone was first used in the Vietnam conflict to boost morale amongst GI's who were suffering from stress and fatigue, but was banned after a few years following several deaths and hundreds of cases involving anything from severe migraines to brain tumours in personnel prescribed the stimulant.  That was in 1973 and Glucuronolactone is still banned for commercial consumption in America this day. The bad news is that the substance never found it's way to Europe in the early days and was therefore never banned by the EU community. An article in this months edition of the British Medical Journal has highlighted a growing number of cases reported by Doctors and Surgeons involving the very same side effects from the 70's.  All of the patients examined were regular drinkers of RedBull and it is believed that the safety of Glucuronolactone is currently under review in at least three major European countries.  Please pass this on to any RedBull drinkers you know, and next time you get a headache after drinking the stuff, you'll know why!   ",

So here it is: Barack Obama will be defeated. Seriously and convincingly defeated. Not due to racism, not due to the forces of reaction, not even due to Karl Rove sending out mind rays over the national cable system. He will lose for one reason above all, one that has been overlooked in any analysis that I've yet seen. Barack Obama will lose because he is a flake.  I'm using the term in its generally accepted sense. A flake is not only a screwup, but someone who truly excels in making bizarre errors and creating incredibly convoluted disasters. A flake is a 'fool with energy', as the Russian proverb puts it. ('A fool is a terrible thing to have around, but a fool with energy is a nightmare'.)  Barack Obama is a flake, and the American people have begun to see it. The chief characteristic of a flake is that he makes choices that are impossible to either understand or explain. These are not the errors of the poor dope who can't grasp the essentials of a situation, or the neurotic who ruins things out of compulsion, or the man suffering chronic bad luck.  The flake has a genius for discovering solutions at perfect right angles to the ordinary world. It's as if he's the product of a totally different evolutionary chain, in a universe where the laws are slightly but distinctly at variance to ours. When given a choice between left and right, the flake goes up — if not through the 8th dimension. And although there's plenty of rationalization, there's never a logical reason for any of it. After awhile, people stop asking.  Obama's rise has been widely portrayed as a kind of millennial Horatio Alger story — young lad from a new state on the outskirts of the American polity, a member of once-despised minority, works his way by slow degrees to within arm's length of the presidency itself. That's all well and good — we need national myths of exactly that type.  [Rest of article here.]",

Please be aware. One incident happened at Metro North Mall and the lady noticed the pipes against her tires, thought something was up and went and told a security officer and they were able to stop something before it happened. Just be careful and always be aware of your surroundings.

        "tweet": "[Collected via e-mail, 1999] Don't forget to look !!!  This is really scary ...  According to an article by Dr. Beverly Clark, in the Journal of the United Medical Association (JUMA), the mystery behind a recent spate of deaths has been solved.  If you haven't already heard about it in the news, here is what happened.  3 women in Chicago, turned up at hospitals over a 5 day period, all with the same symptoms. Fever, chills, and vomiting, followed by muscular collapse, paralysis, and finally, death. There were no outward signs of trauma. Autopsy results showed toxicity in the blood. These women did not know each other, and seemed to have nothing in common. It was discovered, however, that they had all visited the same restaurant (Big Chappies, at Blare Airport), within days of their deaths.  The health department descended on the restaurant, shutting it down. The food, water, and air conditioning were all inspected and tested, to no avail. The big break came when a waitress at the restaurant was rushed to the hospital with similar symptoms. She told doctors that she had been on vacation, and had only went to the restaurant to pick up her check. She did not eat or drink while she was there, but had used the restroom. That is when one toxicologist, remembering an article he had read, drove out to the restaurant, went into the restroom, and lifted the toilet seat. Under the seat, out of normal view, was small spider.  The spider was captured and brought back to the lab, where it was determined to be the South American Blush Spider (arachnius gluteus), so named because of its reddened flesh color. This spider's venom is extremely toxic, but can take several days to take effect. They live in cold, dark, damp climates, and toilet rims provide just the right atmosphere. Several days later a lawyer from Los Angeles showed up at a hospital emergency room. Before his death, he told the doctor, that he had been away on business, had taken a flight from New York, changing planes in Chicago, before returning home. He did not visit Big Chappies while there. He did, as did all of the other victims, have what was determined to be a puncture wound, on his right buttock. Investigators discovered that the flight he was on had originated in South America. The Civilian Aeronautics Board (CAB) ordered an immediate inspection of the toilets of all flights from South America, and discovered the Blush spider's nests on 4 different planes! It is now beleived that these spiders can be anywhere in the country.  So please, before you use a public toilet, lift the seat to check for spiders.  It can save your life!  And please pass this on to everyone you care about.",

They are supposed to target the Genesee County area, but may change their route due to the media coverage that is about to unfold (in this area).  Please pass this along to everyone that you know. I apologize for this interruption in your day, but felt the need to make this known. Please be careful!     If you are or in the area between Detroit and Flint there is an unconfirmed warning to all females to avoid purchasing gas. A Detroit police officer who works in the gang enforcement department released info that a Detroit gang is initiating new members and has requested that the potential new comers shoot a female in the head while pumping gas. This gang is known for performing their initiations in the areas north of Detroit and many times in Flint.  This warning was distributed at Flint area universities which is how I was informed as my sister is going to U of M. Even if it is false what does it hurt to be cautious for the next few days and avoid buying gas if you can or spoil yourself and use a full service gas pump.",

        "tweet": "John Cleese's Letter to the USA To the citizens of the United States of America, in light of your failure to elect a competent President of the USA and thus to govern yourselves, we hereby give notice of the revocation of your independence, effective today.  Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II resumes monarchical duties over all states, commonwealths and other territories. Except Utah, which she does not fancy.  Your new prime minister (The Right Honourable Tony Blair, MP for the 97.8% of you who have, until now, been unaware there's a world outside your borders) will appoint a Minister for America. Congress and the Senate are disbanded. A questionnaire circulated next year will determine whether any of you noticed.  To aid your transition to a British Crown Dependency, the following rules are introduced with immediate effect:  1. Look up revocation in the Oxford English Dictionary. Check aluminium in the pronunciation guide. You will be amazed at just how wrongly you pronounce it. The letter 'U' will be reinstated in words such as 'favour' and 'neighbour'. Likewise you will learn to spell 'doughnut' without skipping half the letters. Generally, you should raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels. Look up vocabulary.  Using the same twenty seven words interspersed with filler noises such as like and you know is an unacceptable and inefficient form of communication. Look up interspersed. There will be no more 'bleeps' in the Jerry Springer show. If you're not old enough to cope with bad language then you should not have chat shows.  2. There is no such thing as U.S. English. We'll let Microsoft know on your behalf. The Microsoft spell-checker will be adjusted to take account of the reinstated letter 'u'.  3. You should learn to distinguish English and Australian accents. It really isn't that hard. English accents are not limited to cockney, upper-class twit or Mancunian (Daphne in Frasier). Scottish dramas such as 'Taggart' will no longer be broadcast with subtitles.You must learn that there is no such place as Devonshire in England. The name of the county is Devon. If you persist in calling it Devonshire, all American States will become shires e.g. Texasshire Floridashire, Louisianashire.  4. You should relearn your original national anthem, God Save The Queen, but only after fully carrying out task 1.  5. You should stop playing American football. There's only one kind of football. What you call American football is not a very good game. The 2.1% of you aware there is a world outside your borders may have noticed no one else plays American football. You should instead play proper football. Initially, it would be best if you played with the girls.  Those of you brave enough will, in time, be allowed to play rugby (which is similar to American football, but does not involve stopping for a rest every twenty seconds or wearing full kevlar body armour like nancies).  You should stop playing baseball. It's not reasonable to host an event called the 'World Series' for a game which is not played outside of America. Instead of baseball, you will be allowed to play a girls' game called rounders, which is baseball without fancy team stripe, oversized gloves, collector cards or hotdogs.  6. You will no longer be allowed to own or carry guns, or anything more dangerous in public than a vegetable peeler. Because you are not sensible enough to handle potentially dangerous items, you need a permit to carry a vegetable peeler.  7. July 4th is no longer a public holiday. November 2nd will be a new national holiday. It will be called Indecisive Day.  8. All American cars are hereby banned. They are crap and it is for your own good. When we show you German cars, you will understand what we mean. All road intersections will be replaced with roundabouts, and you will start driving on the left. At the same time, you will go metric without the benefit of conversion tables. Roundabouts and metrication will help you understand the British sense of humour.  9. Learn to make real chips. Those things you call French fries are not real chips. Fries aren't French, they're Belgian though 97.8% of you (including the guy who discovered fries while in Europe) are not aware of a country called Belgium. Potato chips are properly called crisps. Real chips are thick cut and fried in animal fat. The traditional accompaniment to chips is beer which should be served warm and flat.  10. The cold tasteless stuff you call beer is actually lager. Only proper British Bitter will be referred to as beer. Substances once known as American Beer will henceforth be referred to as Near-Frozen Gnat's Urine, except for the product of the American Budweiser company which will be called Weak Near-Frozen Gnat's Urine. This will allow true Budweiser (as manufactured for the last 1000 years in Pilsen, Czech Republic) to be sold without risk of confusion.  11. The UK will harmonise petrol prices (or Gasoline, as you will be permitted to keep calling it) for those of the former USA, adopting UK petrol prices (roughly $6/US gallon, get used to it).  12. Learn to resolve personal issues without guns, lawyers or therapists. That you need many lawyers and therapists shows you're not adult enough to be independent. If you're not adult enough to sort things out without suing someone or speaking to a therapist, you're not grown up enough to handle a gun.  13. Please tell us who killed JFK. It's been driving us crazy.  14. Tax collectors from Her Majesty's Government will be with you shortly to ensure the acquisition of all revenues due (backdated to 1776).  Thank you for your co-operation.  * John Cleese  [Basil Fawlty, Fawlty Towers, Torquay, Devon, England]",

Anyone that knows me well will know that I don't believe in much. I don't believe in ghosts or all that, and if I get one of those Pass this email on to 50 million people and you will be rich, if you don't you will die etc etc emails, I just delete them. I want you all to pass this email on to as many people as you know, its not a chain email, but pass it on all the same.  Right then, I got home from work last night and went round to my best mates. The first words his mum said to me even before she said hello was don't go into Birmingham on October 6th. She explained to me that a woman from her work was in Birmingham on saturday afternoon, and she was in one of those cash and carry warehouses where you can buy cheap stuff, and anyway, there was an indian/asian looking man in front of her who was struggling to get enough money together to pay for everything in his basket, so she gave him a pound coin so he could pay the 68p or whatever he owed.  When she left the shop he was waiting for her outside. He asked her for her name and address and said that he would give her the money back, but she told him not to worry about it. He then said Ok, you have done me a good turn today so I shall do you one back, do not come into Birmingham town centre on october the 6th.  She didn't take much notice of him, but like me, the more she thought about it, the more she worried, so she went to the police. They took her very seriously and showed her mug shots of known islamic supporters and members of extreme groups in Birmingham, and she saw the man in the book of mugshots.  So, i'm just warning you, if you were going to go to Brum Town Centre on the 6th of October, then I wouldn't. I wasn't going to send this because I didn't want to worry people/look stupid when nothing happened on Oct 6th, but I thought that if I didn't say anything and something happened then I would never forgive myself, so its worth the risk of looking a bit daft. Also, the 6th of October is the England/Greece game, when there are likely to be a lot of people in town's pubs n bars watching it, so if they wanted to do something nasty, it would be a good time.  Please pass this on to anyone you think might go into Birmingham Town Centre on the 6th of October. If you don't pass this email on, you will not get bad luck, and if you pass it on to more than 5 people you won't get good luck, but you might stop someone from getting caught up in whatever supposed to be going on on October the 6th. This is not a chain e-mail.    This came from a friend of my sisters this morning:  Morning all - had a bizarre message from my brother in the early hours this morning...  His friend's girlfriend was shopping in Harrods on the weekend. There was an Arab man in front of her who was buying a number of things with cash - he was a few pounds short so the girl offered him £3 to cover it. He thanked her profusely and left. When she left the store the man followed her out and thanked her again and then warned her not to travel on the Tube today!! (Monday 1st October) She was a little thrown by this so she went to the police. The police were very sceptical but in order to eliminate her suspicions gave her the photo-ID book of all known dissidents in the UK. He was on the second page listed as a known terrorist.  This is apparently true and the police are apparently taking this extremely seriously. The most likely time would be rush hour this evening so please avoid it if you can - who knows it may be nothing but is it worth the risk?  PS - I don't have a lot of people's e-mail addresses so obviously please forward this on to anyone and everyone     Just heard from Jackie - this is a very eerie story. A co-worker just told her that she and her husband were shopping at a Costco last night and they were checking out behind an Arab couple. The Arabs did not have enough money to pay their bill so she offered to give them the money. They said we can't pay you back but we can give you some information instead. They said to stay away from the Baltimore tunnels (specifically, the Harbor Tunnel) for the next few days. She called the FBI and they showed her the new Most Wanted list that just came out and he was one of them - the FBI has not been able to find him - he's apparently still living in Laurel. This woman was so upset that she came to work today and then went home.  It amazing that these people are living amongst us and even with their families and kids in our schools. Anyway, Jackie said they are checking all trucks going into and out of the Balt. tunnels. She advised staying away from Baltimore period through this weekend at least. Tell anyone you think might be affected by this.",

Now, if you know our government I bet they are not expecting a lot of people to call for this refund, and they may be right, because many of us will not be informed of this.  Therefore, this is why I am taking it upon myself to pass on this information, so our community will soon be informed through word-of-mouth about what has been owed to our ancestors all these years.

Pour l’achat de la célèbre île et du plus prestigieux musée au monde, les négociations entre Djilali Mehri et les parties espagnoles et françaises ont eu lieu au plus haut niveau des deux Etats et dans le plus grand secret. En effet, du côté espagnol, c’est le roi Juan Carlos en personne qui a signé la cession de l’île de Palma de Mallorca, devenue désormais propriété à part entière de l’homme d’affaires algérien, bien que la convention signée entre les deux parties stipule que le drapeau espagnol flottera toujours sur l’île touristique. Après des tractations passées dans le plus grand secret depuis plusieurs mois, l’accord a été parachevé et signé hier à 16 h au palais royal Palacio de Oriente de la capitale espagnole Madrid. La cérémonie de signature s’est tenue en présence du chef du gouvernement espagnol Mariano Rajoy, de la reine Sofia qui n’a pu retenir ses larmes et de la fille de Mehri, Nadjet, qui était aux anges. Notons que cette dernière est en train de rédiger un livre dédié à son père. Il faut rappeler que Palma de Mallorca est la principale et la plus célèbre des îles Baléares. L’île achetée par Djilali Mehri compte plus de 400 00 habitants et reçoit régulièrement des centaines de milliers de touristes venant du monde entier. Depuis le début de la crise économique, beaucoup d’Algériens ont investi en Espagne, notamment en Andalousie, en rachetant des maisons et des appartements, mais la grosse surprise vient de Djilali Mehri qui vient de s’approprier l’une des plus belles îles au monde. Récemment, l’émir du Qatar Hamad Ben Khalifa Al Thani avait fait de même en rachetant pas moins de six îles en Grèce, un autre pays touché par la crise économique. Djilali Mehri s’était déplacé dans la même matinée hier à Paris pour signer un autre acte d’achat de 94% des actions du Musée du Louvre. L’acte a été signé par le milliardaire algérien d’un côté, et de Aurélie Filippetti, ministre française de la culture et de la communication de l’autre. La signature de l’acte de cession des parts a eu lieu au bureau du notaire Jean-Jaques Dusaumon, rue Kleber, à deux cents mètres de l’Arc de triomphe à Paris. Contacté hier soir par Le Temps d’ Algérie, Djilali Mehri a confirmé l’achat de l’île espagnole et du musée du Louvre à Paris, mais a refusé de donner un quelconque chiffre concernant les deux transactions. M. Mehri, qui est connu pour ses actions secrètes, notamment lorsqu’il s’agit de dons ou de grandes affaires, a avoué toutefois que l’achat du Louvre est un ancien projet, et que c’est une question de fierté et d’honneur. En effet, connu pour être un grand collectionneur d’œuvres d’art, Djilali Mehri n’a pas oublié ce jour de juillet 1967, lorsque des agents du musée lui avaient refusé l’accès à la salle où était exposé un tableau de Fromentin, sous prétexte qu’une personnalité française était attendue ce jour-là. Cet amoureux de l’art, notamment des œuvres d’orientalistes tels que Fromentin et Dinet, quitta le musée en se promettant de s’approprier toutes les œuvres qui s’y trouvaient. 45 ans après, il a concrétisé son vœu. Le musée du Louvre est bel et bien devenu propriété de l’homme d’affaires algérien. http://satirique.canalblog.comarchives/2014/02/21/29270752.htmlfb_action_ids=745473002152034&fb_action_types=og.likes&fb_source=aggregation&fb_aggregation_id=288381481237582",

I have been asked by state and local authorities to write this email in order to get the word out to car drivers of a very dangerous prank that is occurring in numerous states.  Some person or persons have been affixing hypodermic needles to the underside of gas pump handles. These needles appear to be infected with HIV positive blood. In the Jacksonville area alone there have been 17 cases of people being stuck by these needles over the past five months. We have verified reports of at least 12 others in various states around the country.  It is believed that these may be copycat incidents due to someone reading about the crimes or seeing them reported on the television. At this point no one has been arrested and catching the perpetrator(s) has become our top priority.  Shockingly, of the 17 people who where stuck, eight have tested HIV positive and because of the nature of the disease, the others could test positive in a couple years.  Evidently the consumers go to fill their car with gas, and when picking up the pump handle get stuck with the infected needle. IT IS IMPERATIVE TO CAREFULLY CHECK THE HANDLE of the gas pump each time you use one. LOOK AT EVERY SURFACE YOUR HAND MAY TOUCH, INCLUDING UNDER THE HANDLE.  If you do find a needle affixed to one, immediately contact your local police department so they can collect the evidence.  PLEASE HELP US BY MAINTAINING A VIGILANCE AND BY FORWARDING THIS EMAIL TO ANYONE YOU KNOW WHO DRIVES. THE MORE PEOPLE WHO KNOW OF THIS THE BETTER PROTECTED WE CAN ALL BE.   ",

This one, however, is a friend of a friend and I've given it enough credibility in my mind that I'm writing it up and sending it out to all of you.  My friend's friend was dating a guy from Afghanistan up until a month ago. She had a date with him around 9/6 and was stood up. She was understandably upset and went to his home to find it completely emptied. On 9/10, she received a letter from her boyfriend explaining that he wished he could tell her why he had left and that he was sorry it had to be like that. The part worth mentioning is that he BEGGED her not to get on any commercial airlines on 9/11 and to not to go any malls on Halloween. As soon as everything happened on the 11th, she called the FBI and has since turned over the letter.  This is not an email that I've received and decided to pass on. This came from a phone conversation with a long-time friend of mine last night.  I may be wrong, and I hope I am. However, with one of his warnings being correct and devastating, I'm not willing to take the chance on the second and wanted to make sure that people I cared about had the same information that I did.",

It was Mickelson versus the other three which included some of the deepest pockets among the membership. The stakes: $5000 skins and a pot of $130,000, $100,000 of which was contributed by Mickelson for the low net score — Mickelson would play off scratch.  According to one of the threesome which obviously will remain anonymous, everything was going great until the back 9 when Mickelson really could not believe the good fortune of 'chuckie'. He was draining everything on the greens and when he missed the green twice he had two chip-ins. Phil's lead on the scorecard looked safe but in the clubhouse we added it up and lo and behold, Phil owed $200,000. And then it got ugly. The stories by witnesses conflict, but in effect Mickelson tried to pass the bets off as laugh on the first tee and insisted there was no way he would bet hundreds of thousands on golf. Mickelson believed the standard one dollar game was in effect.  The threesome was having none of it and before you know it the foursome was sitting in the office of Billy Payne who was none too happy about the loud conversations taking place in the dining room. But even in the privacy of the office, Mickelson was being very difficult. According to the same anonymous member Phil slipped up and admitted that he initiated the stakes and set the terms of the bet. Then he protested at having to pay so much and offered 30 cents on the dollar right then and there, take it or leave it. Billy was aghast and told Phil, you will arrange to pay every dollar or you will never be welcome at Augusta again, TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT. Mickelson tried to protest and even made a snide remark that Billy couldn't stop him from being welcome at Augusta every April. Billy simply asked are you taking it or leaving it.  Mickelson later called his accountant with the banking details of 'chuckie' and an arrangement was made for a wire transfer of an undisclosed amount. The worse of this may not be over as the other member of the threesome was upset enough to call the PGA Tour. When contacted for a comment, the PGA Tour declined to comment and would not even acknowledge whether or not they have been contacted about the conflict at Augusta National.  From GolfWeek Insider",

The scam goes like this: The grandma calls the Department of Children and Family Services and states that the unemployed daughter is not capable of caring for these children. DCFS agrees and states that the child or children will need to go to foster care.  The grandma then volunteers to be the foster parent, and thus receives a check for $1500 per child per month in Illinois. Total yearly income: $144,000 tax-free, not to mention free healthcare (Medicaid) plus a monthly Link card entitling her to free groceries, etc, and a voucher for 250 free cell phone minutes per month.

She was halfway through with her sandwich when she noticed a clump of mayonnaise on the side of her bun. She licked it off, but when she tasted it she immediately realized things were not right.' I'm not gonna lie,' McDowell said. 'On Birthdays and holidays I give my man a little something extra in the bedroom, you know? So when I licked the mayo off of the bun, the texture was familiar.'",

Andy Rooney said on 60 minutes a few weeks back: (for those of you that don't know Andy Rooney, he is an 82 year old US TV commentator)  I like big cars, big boats, big motorcycles, big houses and big campfires.  I believe the money I make belongs to me and my family, not some governmental stooge with a bad comb-over who wants to give it away to crack addicts for squirting out babies.  Guns do not make you a killer. I think killing makes you a killer. You can kill someone with a baseball bat or a car, but no one is trying to ban you from driving to the ball game.  I believe they are called the Boy Scouts for a reason, that is why there are no girls allowed. Girls belong in the Girl Scouts!  I think that if you feel homosexuality is wrong, it is not a phobia, it is an opinion.  I don't think being a minority makes you a victim of anything except numbers. The only things I can think of that are truly discriminatory are things like the United Negro College Fund, Jet Magazine, Black Entertainment Television, and Miss Black America.  Try to have things like the United Caucasian College Fund, Cloud Magazine, White entertainment Television, or Miss White America and see what happens. Jesse  Jackson will be knocking down your door.  I have the right NOT to be tolerant of others because they are different, weird, or tick me off. When 70% of the people who get arrested are black, in cities where 70% of the population is black, that is not racial profiling, it is the law of statistics.  I know what sex is, and there are not varying degrees of it. If I received sex from one of the subordinates in my office, it wouldn't be a private matter or my personal business. I would be FIRED immediately!  I believe that if you are selling me a milk shake, a pack of cigarettes, a newspaper or a hotel room, you must do it in English! As a matter of fact, if you want to be an American citizen you should have to speak English!  My father and grandfather shouldn't have to die in vain so you can leave the countries you were born in to come over and disrespect ours. I think the police should have every right to shoot your sorry ass if you threaten them after they tell you to stop. If you can't understand the word freeze or stop in English, see the above lines.  I feel much safer letting a machine with no political affiliation recount votes when needed. I know what the definition of lying is.  I don't think just because you were not born in this country, you are qualified for any special loan programs, government sponsored bank loans or tax breaks, etc., so you can open a hotel, coffee shop, trinket store, or any other business. We did not go to the aid of certain foreign countries and risk our lives in wars to defend their freedoms so that decades later they could come over here and tell us our constitution is a living document and open to their interpretations.  I don't hate the rich. I don't pity the poor.  I know wrestling is fake, but so are movies and television, and that doesn't stop you from watching them.  I believe a self-righteous liberal or conservative with a cause is more dangerous than a Hell's Angel with an attitude.  I think Bill Gates has every right to keep every penny he made and continue to make more. If it ticks you off, go and invent the next operating system that's better and put your name on the building. Ask your buddy that invented the Internet to help you.  It doesn't take a whole village to raise a child right, but it does take a parent to stand up to the kid and smack their little ass when necessary and say NO.  I think tattoos and piercing are fine if you want them, but please don't pretend they are a political statement. And . . . Please stay home until that new lip ring heals, I don't want to look at your ugly infected mouth as you serve me french fries!  I am sick of Political Correctness and of all the suck ups that go along with it. I know a lot of black people, and not a single one of them was born in Africa, so how can they be African-Americans? Besides, Africa is a continent. I don't go around saying I am a European-American because my great, great, great, great, great, great grandfather was from Europe. I am proud to be from America and nowhere else.  And if you don't like my point of view, tough!  Andy is 83 and entitled to his opinion.",

La police ne fait rien pour protéger les familles et met les militaires qui se défendent en garde à vue. Quant à la réaction de la hierarchie militaire, ça se passe de commentaire… Bonjour, Je tiens à informer que des évènements graves se déroulent actuellement sur Brive, garnison du 126ème RI! L’histoire commence dans une résidence privée ou des familles avec enfants profitent de ce qui paie! Des gens de la cité voisine, viennent squatter,seulement ils commencent a mettre le souk donc une invitation à sortir leur est faite car leur dérive commence a devenir dangereuse, pour les enfants notamment! Un mili étant avec sa compagne sur les lieux, leur demande de quitter les lieux, le ton monte car ces messieurs sont accompagnés et sont en bande! ça dégénère, un autre militaire arrive et la situation dégénère, le second militaire accompagné de sa compagne enceinte tente d’arrêter ça car son compagnon se fait passer à tabac! Elle se fait à son tour prendre à partie alors qu’elle est enceinte et que cela se voit!!! Bilan, elle finit à l’hôpital et perd son petit garçon à la suite des coups reçu!!! Il nous semble que cet acte porte un nom et fait partie d’une certaine catégorie! Le lendemain, des militaires se réunissent et vont dans le quartier concernés! Ils y vont non armés comme certains pourraient le prétendre! Le ton monte parce que « eh les militaires vous faites quoi chez nous!!! » je ne cite que les débuts des propos qui sont soft car la suite, vous pourrez l’imaginer amplement! ça commence à courir, forcément ça galope bien en face donc aucun coup aura été donné de la part des militaires! seulement en face, les gens du quartier ont tirer sur les militaires à coups de feu! A l’arrivée des forces de l’ordre et afin de ne pas trop envenimer les choses les militaires décident de quitter les lieux sans heurt avec les forces de l’ordre que nous respectons!!! Les jeunes eux, par la suite s’en prendront à eux et aux pompiers venus pour éteindre les différents feux! Le lendemain, 3 militaires isolés en ville dont un gars des iles se sont fait prendre en embuscade par les gens du même quartier, un militaire prendra un coup de couteau et finira à l’hôpital! Les gens de ce quartier n’en resteront pas là, ils iront aux abords de la résidence et donnent des coups de feu sur les appartements des militaires! Le soir même,tard, après ces évènements, le régiment est rassemblé par le chef de corps, annonce faite de la mort du bébé et des incidents, appel au calme fait par le chef de corps et les hautes autorités! seulement décision d’interdire la sortie aux militaires, notamment à tous les tahitiens! Renfort de CRS arrivé sur Brive, car peur que d’autres garnisons ne s’en mêlent,il faut dire et surtout avouer que Brive n’est pas la seule garnison à avoir des soucis avec les quartiers! Seulement impunité des gens du quartiers des chapélies qui viennent provoquer aux abords direct de la caserne et menacent entre autre tous militaires rentrant du dimanche, trajet gare/ caserne qui passe par chez eux! Aucune interpellation des gens concernés par la mort de ce bébé,par contre le papa et 2 autres militaires sont placés en garde à vue!!! Dimanche soir un jeune engagé, rentrant de ses perms et n’étant pas au courant des évènements a été attaqué par derrière et à subi des coups de cutter dans le dos! A savoir que lors de la venue des militaires dans ce quartier pour voir les auteurs! les militaires n’étaient pas constitués de casseurs, voleurs ou autres types d’individus malsains et sans valeurs! Ce matin 2 autres étaient appelés pour soi-disant témoignage ce matin à 9 heures du matin, en fait ce n’était pas pour prendre des témoignages mais pour placer des militaires en garde à vue! Là, je parle pour l’un d’eux, qui est mon ami, mon frère d’arme et je peux garantir les yeux fermés, qu’il n’y a pas plus « CLEAN » que lui car ce CCH est d’une valeur inestimable, toute personne le connaissant pourrait se porter garant de crédibilité! A notre plus grande surprise (Mauvaise), les médias ne relatent que très peu les faits, laissant même entendre que les fauteurs de trouble seraient les militaires! Les commentaires de certains compatriotes sont tout simplement insultants pour rester au premier degré! Nous nous demandons ou est la justice? Pourquoi les policiers ne sont-ils pas avec nous alors qu’ils ont tous les éléments? Pourquoi les médias nous salissent-ils comme ça?? Pourquoi? et de qui viennent les ordres? Je crois que si nous nous posons les bonnes questions, les réponses font peur…………! Pour l’instant il n’y a que France 3 qui parle de cette affaire en déformant la réalité.",

        "tweet": "I had one of the most troubling, most disturbing conversations with Dr. Suzanne Allen, head of emergency services at the Johnson City Medical Center in Tennessee. We were discussing the future and I asked her had she seen an affects of Obama Care in her work?  Oh, yes. We are seeing cutbacks throughout the services we provide. For example, we are now having to deal with patients who would normally receive dialysis can no longer be accepted. In the past, there was always automatic approval under Medicare for anyone who needed dialysis — not anymore. So, what will be their outcome? They will die soon without dialysis, she stated.  What about other services? She indicated as of 2013 (after the election), no one over 75 will be given major medical procedures unless approved by locally administered Ethics Panels. These Panels will determine whether a patient receives medical treatment or not.  While details on specific operating procedures and schedules, Dr. Allen points out that most life-threatening emergencies do not occur during normal hospital business hours, and if there are emergencies that depend to be resolve within minutes or just few hours, the likely hood of getting these Panels approval in time to save a life are going to be very challenging and difficult, if not impossible she said.  This applies to major operations such as receiving stents, bypass surgery, kidney operations, or treating for an aneurysm that would be normally covered under Medicare today. In other words, if you needed a life-saving operation, Medicare will not provide coverage anymore after 2013 if you are 75 or over. When in 2013? We haven't been given a specific date — could be in January or July — but it's after the election.  This is shocking to any of us who will be 75 this year. Her advice — get healthy and stay healthy. We do not know the specifics of the actual implementation of the full Obama Care policies and procedures — they haven't filtered down to the local level yet. But we are already seeing severe cuts in what we provide to the elderly — we refused dialysis to an individual who was 78 just the other day, we refused to give stents to a gentleman who was in his late 80s. Every day, she said, we are seeing these cutbacks aimed at reducing care across the board for anyone who is over 75.  We can only hope that Obama Care will be overturned by the Supreme Court — otherwise, this is a death sentence to those who are over 75. Perhaps you should pass this on to your friends who are thinking of voting for Obama this year.  Regardless if you have private health care coverage now (I have Aetna Medicare Part B) — it will no longer apply after 2013 if the Ethics Panels disapprove of a procedure that may save your life. Scary, scary, scary. Think about this? You? Your parents? Your loved ones?  Didn't know about it? Of course, not. As Nancy Pelosi said, well, if you want to know what's in the bill, you'll have to pass it. Two years after it was passed, most people still do not know fully what is in the bill.  This is a graphic reminder of the need to stay healthy. Get your plot now at Forest Lawn, while they last. Is this a death sentence to those of us who will reach 75? Yes!     Forget about getting to age 75, this exact thing happened to me this morning at Danbury hospital here in Ct. I was scheduled for a cardio-lite stress test. This is a tread mill stress test where during the process they inject nuclear dye into your blood stream and then put you in a CAT scan or something similar and take a picture of your heart. If all is good, the heart shows up red, if there are blocked arteries anywhere that portion of the heart shows up pink. I have had three of these tests in the past twelve years due to blocked arteries discovered in 2000. They use the test to determine if I need a roto-rooter or a bypass operation. So I arrive at the hospital at 8am this morning and I am in the process of checking in at Cardiology and the lady says that my appointment has been cancelled. She makes a call and speaks with someone and hands me the phone. It is a nurse in cardiology who says that my medical coverage denied the procedure. I said it was routine, part of my heart maintenance process and ordered by my PCP and with approval from my Cardiologist who is the head of Danbury Cardiology which is right where I was standing. She goes, yes but we were denied our request. So I say, I have Medicare so what is my backup insurance doing denying anything. Then the bombshell, she says it was the Medicare board that denied the procedure. At that point, I turn to everyone behind me, and it was a long line, and I say to them well you won't have to wait too long today because my stress test procedure was just cancelled by a Medicare Death Panel. I am only 67 so can you imagine what is going to happen when we really get old. The entire waiting room and everyone there from patients to staff just went dead silent. So I turn to the front desk and tell them,  I guess I will have to write a letter to the editor of the Danbury News Times and call my Senators and Congressman and let them know the Death Panels have already convened. Then I walked out. By the time I got home the message machine was blinking. My PCP had already called and so did the hospital and guess what, Medicare decided to approve my stress test procedure and if I could get back down to the hospital they would fit me in right now for this 3 hour procedure. I told them I couldn't make it, that I was going fishing because I didn't know how many more fishing trips I could get in before I went into cardiac arrest but not to worry about me costing the government any money because I am a 30% disabled Army veteran, due to Agent Orange poisoning which is what caused this heart problem to begin with, and I qualify to be buried for free in a plain pine wrapper in the cheap graves section at any National Cemetery...     I was talking last night (Sunday) with my son-in-law's brother who is a Neurosurgeon at Emory Hospital in Atlanta , which, if you are not familiar with it, ranks up there with the finest hospitals in the country.  A group of non-doctors, from 'our' (????) country's Department of Health arrived last week at Emory for a two day session and is on their rounds around the country to make sure every hospital fully understands the new rules (which start in December (after the elections) concerning treating all patients over 70 years of age.  You heard of the death squads early on after Obamacare was passed and many people claimed it was not true and that people were misquoting what was in the bill. Well if you believed this you are wrong. DEAD WRONG!  This group informed the staff Emory and all the doctors present that they will very soon not be allowed to operate on anyone over 70 (no matter how urgent or life threatening the situation is), without first having it approved by a board of eight doctors. Failure to comply will result in a huge financial burden to the hospital and more than likely the doctor will lose his/her ability to practice medicine anywhere in the country.  This board is to be established at every hospital in the country and the board members will only work eight hours a day. We will discuss this a little later on as the DOH group almost got lynched at this point by the doctors who were present.  This board of doctors will not be made up of active doctors. All the doctors must be retired - and may even be retired up to 30 or 40 years. Further, Obamacare sees no need or requirement for them to be skilled in surgery. Another very vocal argument broke out here as these doctors likely may not even be aware of what advancements have taken place in surgery over the last 5-10 years nor what is going today as well. Also, anyone who has ever been a doctor can serve on these boards. For example, Individuals with skills only in pediatrics, podiatry, dermatology, etc., may be making decisions as to whether a brain operation is required or not.  The point that got the Emery doctors so upset originally was that the Death Board will be available on 8 hours during the day. And once their 8 hour shift is up, they may have to wait 16 hours to get in touch with them and another hour or two or three to get a decision and permission to operate.  But they daily have cases in which it is crucial to operate within 30 minutes.  The staff at Emory Hospital will be coordinating with other hospitals and together they will make a concerted effort to bring about significant changes to this portion of Obamacare.  When the question was raised from the floor by a young doctor as to whether doctors had to get permission to operate on congressmen and/or future members of the executive branch who would later be over 70, the answer was, Of course not!  When the same young doctor asked, Why not. They refused to answer.",

Wow. James Freaking Carville. Of all people. Here's an excerpt, as quoted by Amazon.com:     Ideologies aren't all that important. What's important is psychology.  The Democratic constituency is just like a herd of cows. All you have to do is lay out enough silage and they come running. That's why I became an operative working with Democrats. With Democrats all you have to do is make a lot of noise, lay out the hay, and be ready to use the ole cattle prod in case a few want to bolt the herd.  Eighty percent of the people who call themselves Democrats don't have a clue as to political reality.  What amazes me is that you could take a group of people who are hard workers and convince them that they should support social programs that were the exact opposite of their own personal convictions. Put a little fear here and there and you can get people to vote any way you want.  The voter is basically dumb and lazy. The reason I became a Democratic operative instead of a Republican was because there were more Democrats that didn't have a clue than there were Republicans.  Truth is relative. Truth is what you can make the voter believe is the truth. If you're smart enough, truth is what you make the voter think it is. That's why I'm a Democrat. I can make the Democratic voters think whatever I want them to.",

It must be true given the source, right?  The Newsweek poll alleges that 67 percent of Americans are unhappy with the direction the country is headed and 69 percent of the country is unhappy with the performance of the president. In essence 2/3s of the citizenry just ain't happy and want a change.  So being the knuckle dragger I am, I started thinking, ''What we are so unhappy about?''  Is it that we have electricity and running water 24 hours a day, 7 days a week? Is our unhappiness the result of having air conditioning in the summer and heating in the winter? Could it be that 95.4 percent of these unhappy folks have a job? Maybe it is the ability to walk into a grocery store at any time and see more food in moments than Darfur has seen in the last year?  [ ...]  We are among the most blessed people on Earth and should thank God several times a day, or at least be thankful and appreciative.  With hurricanes, tornados, fires out of control, mud slides, flooding, severe thunderstorms tearing up the country from one end to another, and with the threat of bird flu and terrorist attacks, Are we sure this is a good time to take God out of the Pledge of Allegiance?

        "tweet": "Shannon could hear the footsteps behind her as she walked toward home. The thought of being followed made her heart beat faster. You're being silly, she told herself, no one is following you. To be safe she began to walk faster, but the footsteps kept up with her pace. She was afraid to look back and she was glad she was almost home. Shannon said a quick prayer, God please get me home safe. She saw the porch light burning and ran the rest of the way to her house.  Once inside she leaned against the door for a moment, relieved to be in the safety of her home. She glanced out the window to see if anyone was there. The sidewalk was empty. After tossing her books on the sofa she decided to grab a snack and get on line. There she could talk to strangers without being afraid. After all, no one knew who she really was and couldn't hurt her. She logged on under her screen name ByAngel213. Checking her Buddy List she saw GoTo123 was on. She sent him an instant message:  ByAngel213: Hi I'm glad you are on! I thought someone was following me home today. It was really weird!  GoTo123: LOL You watch too much TV. Why would someone be following you? Don't you live in a safe neighborhood?  ByAngel213: Of course I do... LOL... I guess it was my imagination... cause I didn't see anybody when I looked out.  GoTo123: Unless you gave your name out on line... You haven't done that have you?  ByAngel213: Of course not. I'm not stupid you know.  GoTo123: Did you have a softball game after school today?  ByAngel213: Yes and we won!!  GoTo123: That's great! Who did you play?  ByAngel213: We played the Hornets... LOL..their uniforms are so gross! They look like bees... LOL  GoThere123: What is your team called?  ByAngel213: We are the Canton Cats. We have tiger paws on our uniforms. They are really kewl.  GoTo123: Do you pitch or what?  ByAngel213: No... I play second base. I got to go.. My homework has to be done before my parents get home. I don't want them mad at me...Bye  GoTo123: Catch you later.. Bye  GoTo123 decided it was time to teach Angel a lesson. One she would never forget. He went to the member menu and began to search for her profile. When it came up he highlighted it and printed it out. He took out a pen and began to write down what he knew about Angel so far.  Her name: Shannon. Birthday: Jan. 3, 1985. Age:13. State where she lived: North Carolina. Hobbies: softball, chorus, skating and going to the mall. Besides this information he knew she lived in Canton. She had just told him. He knew she stayed by herself until 6:30 every afternoon until her parents came home from work. He knew she played softball on Thursday afternoons on the school team and the team was named the Canton Cats. Her favorite number 7 was printed on her jersey. He knew she was in the seventh grade at the Canton Junior High School. She had told him all this in the conversations they had on line. He had enough information to find her now.  She'll be so surprised, he thought, she doesn't even know what she has done.  Shannon didn't tell her parents about the incident on the way home from the ball park that day. She didn't want them to make a scene and stop her from walking home from the softball games. Parents were always overreacting and hers were the worst. It made her wish she was not an only child. Maybe if she had brothers and sisters her parents wouldn't be so overprotective.  By Thursday Shannon had forgotten about the footsteps following her. Her game was in full swing when suddenly she felt someone staring at her. It was then that the memory came back. She glanced up from her second base position to see a man watching her closely. He was leaning against the fence behind first base and he smiled when she looked at him. He didn't look scary and she quickly dismissed the fear she had felt.  After the game he sat on a bleacher while she talked to the coach. She noticed his smile once again as she walked past him. He nodded and she smiled back. He noticed her name on back of the shirt. He knew he had found her. Quietly he walked a safe distance behind her. He didn't want to frighten her and have to explain what he was doing to anyone.  It was only a few blocks to Shannon's home and once he saw where she lived he quickly returned to the park to get his car. Now he had to wait. He decided to get a bite to eat until the time came to go to Shannon's house. He drove to a fast food restaurant and sat there until time to make his move.  Shannon was in her room later that evening when she heard voices in the living room. Shannon, come here, her father called. He sounded upset and she couldn't imagine why. She went into the room to see the man from the ballpark sitting on the sofa. Sit down, her father began, this man is a policeman and he has just told us a most interesting story about you.  Shannon moved cautiously to a chair across from the man. How could he tell her parents anything? She had never seen him before today!  Do you know who I am Shannon? The man asked.  No... Shannon answered.  I am your on line friend, GoTo123.  Shannon was stunned. That's impossible! GoTo is a kid my age! He's 14 and he lives in Michigan!  The man smiled. I know I told you all that... but it wasn't true. You see, Shannon, there are people on line who pretend to be kids I was one of them. But while others do it to find kids and hurt them, I belong to a group of parents who do it to protect kids from predators. I came here to find you to teach you how dangerous it is to give out too much information to people online. You told me enough about yourself to make it easy for me to find you. Your name, the school you went to, the name of your ball team and the position you played. The number and name on your jersey just made finding you a breeze.  Shannon was stunned. You mean you don't live in Michigan?  He laughed. No, I live in Raleigh. It made you feel safe to think I was so far away, didn't it? She nodded. I had a friend whose daughter was like you. Only she wasn't as lucky. The guy found her and murdered her while she was home alone. Kids are taught not to tell anyone when they are alone, yet they do it all the time on line. The wrong people trick you into giving out information a little here and there online. Before you know it, you have told them enough for them to find you without even realizing you have done it. I hope you've learned a lesson from this and won't do it again.  I won't, Shannon promised solemnly.  Will you tell others about this so they will be safe too?  It's a promise!  That night Shannon and her dad and Mom all knelt down together and prayed. They thanked God for protecting Shannon from what could have been a tragic situation.",

Wright epitomizes the thoughts and actions that have prevented and continue to prevent black America from moving ahead and achieving their potential as a people. He suggests that this United States of America made up of sons and daughters of immigrants (I'm talking of the millions of 1st, 2nd, 3rd generation immigrants in this country) of every race, creed, color and religion each and everyone of them who had nothing to do with slavery, some how owe something to a group of people who have never been slaves?  Its amazing. It seems everyone is to blame for the shambles black society is in with its violence, drugs, high school drop out rates, misogyny, and a host of other real and virulent problems, except for the very people who engage in such behavior.  Enough. As a society, culture or people, they should look within themselves and fix their problems. When did this man become the spokesman for the 'black church'? And of course his church is different, but that doesn't mean his message and philosophy is acceptable, or productive or non-offensive or not-racist or indicative or our greater cultural behaviors, values and norms Americans.  And yes, the link between this man and Obama really does matter. At a very minimum, it provides insight into the political and philosophical strain that Obama adheres to.",

We've all been putting in long hours but we've really come together as a group and I love that. Big thanks to Omar for putting up the poster that says There is no I in team as well as the one that says Hang In There, Baby. That cat is hilarious. However, while we are fighting a jihad, we can't forget to take care of the cave. And frankly I have a few concerns.  First of all, while it's good to be concerned about cruise missiles, we should be even more concerned about the scorpions in our cave. Hey, you don't want to be stung and neither do I, so we need to sweep the cave daily. I've posted a sign-up sheet near the main cave opening.  Second, it's not often I make a video address but when I do, I'm trying to scare the most powerful country on earth, okay? That means that while we're taping, please do not ride your razor scooter in the background. Just while we're taping. Thanks.  Third point, and this is a touchy one. As you know, by edict, we're not supposed to shave our beards. But I need everyone to just think hygiene, especially after mealtime. We're all in this together.  Fourth: food. I bought a box of Cheez-Its recently, clearly wrote Osama on the front, and put it on the top shelf. Today, my Cheez-Its were gone. Consideration. That's all I'm saying.  Finally, we've heard that there may be American soldiers in disguise trying to infiltrate our ranks. I want to set up patrols to look for them. First patrol will be Omar, Muhammed, Abdul, Akbar, and Richard.  Love you lots.  Osama",

        "tweet": "WHERE IS THE MONEY COMING FROM ?  By MAUREEN DOWD  Published: June 29, 2008  OBAMA'S TROUBLING INTERNET FUND RAISING  Certainly the most interesting and potentially devastating phone call I have received during this election cycle came this week from one of the Obama's campaign internet geeks. These are the staffers who devised Obama's internet fund raising campaign which raised in the neighborhood of $200 million so far. That is more then twice the total funds raised by any candidate in history — and this was all from the internet campaign.  What I learned from this insider was shocking but I guess we shouldn't be surprised that when it comes to fund raising there simply are no rules that can't be broken and no ethics that prevail.  Obama's internet campaign started out innocently enough with basic e-mail networking, lists saved from previous party campaigns and from  supporters who visited any of the Obama campaign web sites. Small contributions came in from these sources and the internet campaign staff were more than pleased by the results.  Then, about two months into the campaign the daily contribution intake multiplied. Where was it coming from? One of the web site security monitors began to notice the bulk of the contributions were clearly coming in from overseas internet service providers and at the rate and frequency of transmission it was clear these donations were programmed by a very sophisticated user.  While the security people were not able to track most of the sources due to firewalls and other blocking devices put on these contributions they were able to collate the number of contributions that were coming in seemingly from individuals but the funds were from only a few credit card accounts and bank electronic funds transfers. The internet service providers (ISP) they were able to trace were from Saudi Arabia, Iran, and other Middle Eastern countries. One of the banks used for fund transfers was also located in Saudi Arabia.  Another concentrated group of donations was traced to a Chinese ISP with a similar pattern of limited credit card charges.  It became clear that these donations were very likely coming from sources other than American voters. This was discussed at length within the campaign and the decision was made that none of these donations violated campaign financing laws.  It was also decided that it was not the responsibility of the campaign to audit these millions of contributions as to the actual source (specific credit card number or bank transfer account numbers) to insure that none of these internet contributors exceeded the legal maximum donation on a cumulative basis of many small donations. They also found the record keeping was not complete enough to do it anyway.  This is a shocking revelation.  We have been concerned about the legality of bundling contributions after the recent exposure of illegal bundlers but now it appears we may have an even greater problem.  I guess we should have been somewhat suspicious when the numbers started to come out. We were told (no proof offered) that the Obama internet contributions were from $10.00 to $25.00 or so.  If the $200,000,000 is right, and the average contribution was $15.00, that would mean over 13 million individuals made contributions? That would also be 13 million contributions would need to be processed. How did all that happen?  I believe the Obama campaign's internet fund raising needs a serious, in depth investigation and audit. It also appears the whole question of internet fund raising needs investigation by the legislature and perhaps new laws to insure it complies not only with the letter of these laws but the spirit as well.",

        "tweet": "As all of you know, Philadelphia Police Officer Chuck Cassidy was shot in the head at a dunkin donuts in Philadelphia on October 31, 2007. He was at the dunkin donuts for a routine stop to check in on them because they are a place prone to robbery.  As he pulled up he did not know that inside a thug, who had robbed the same dunkin donuts before and was waving a gun around, demanding money. As Officer Cassidy opened the door he was shot point blank in the head. He fell to the ground bleeding with a bullet wound to his head. The suspect ran from the dunkin donuts momentarily then returned to lean over Officer Cassidy's dying body and take his gun from him and then he ran off. Officer Cassidy passed away the next day, November 1 around 9:30 am. He leaves behind a wife and three children. The suspect was just caught in Florida and there was a reward offered to anyone with information leading to his arrest.  Dunkin Donuts declined to donate any money to the fund!  I think this is despicable and I would like to ask everyone to think twice before spending money at a dunkin donuts.  They should have been the first business to offer up money. Chickie's & Pete's and Finnegan's Wake were the first businesses in the city to come up with first $50,000 for the reward (it wound up being $150,000). I think they should be commended and I think dunkin donuts should be put out of business!!!  Thanks for listening to my rant, I just feel very strongly about this and want as many people as possible to know.  Please pass this info along to everyone you know and pray for Officer Cassidy's family. Thanks!!!",

EN DONNE LA NAUSÉE RIEN QUE D'Y PENSER.Hello tout le monde, Incroyable que de telles choses se produisent, encore, au 21ème siècle. John LENNON était dans le juste lorsqu'il a écrit cette phrase dans sa chanson IMAGINE ... et   AUCUNE RELIGION Le fanatisme a toujours été la cause de distorcions.Un événement de gala s'est déroulé à Gaza. Le Hamas a parrainé le mariage de 450 couples.La majorité des fiancés étaient âgés de 25 à 30 ans et la majorité des petites fiancées avaient MOINS DE 12 ANS.Le monde ignore que les plus répugnantes affaires d'abus sexuels sur des enfants, tortures et sodomisations sont commis dans les tréfonds de Gaza les mariages des pédophiles du Hamas s'organisent avec des enfants d'à peine 4 ans, ceci avec l'autorisation de la loi islamique.Cette information a été dévoilée par Phd Paul L.Williams, publiée et traduite au Brésil .De grands dignitaires musulmans, comme Mahmud Zahar, un leader du Hamas ont personnellement félicité les couples au cours de cette cérémonietrès soigneusement planifiée.Nous sommes heureux de dire à l'Amérique qu'elle ne peut nier votre joie  s'est exprimé Zahar envers les fiancés tous vêtus, pour l'occasion, du même costume sombre.Chaque fiancé a reçu en cadeau du Hamas,  la somme de 500 dollars. Les fillettes en pré-purberté toutes vêtues de blanc et maquillées de façon excessive, ont, elles, reçu un bouquet de mariée. Nous offrons ce mariage comme cadeau pour notre peuple qui fait face au siège et à la guerre a commenté l'homme fort du Hamas, Ibrahim Salaf.Les photos de cette cérémonie de mariages relatent cette sordide histoire.Le Centre International de Recherches des Femmes estiment qu'il existe 51 millions de fillettes fiancées dans le monde, pour la plupart en pays musulmans.30% de ces petites fiancées sont battues par leur mari. Tous les ans, 3 millions de ces fillettes musulmanes sont soumises à des mutilations. La pratique de cette pédophilie reçoit l'appui de l'Islam radical.De plus,  le plus connu de tous ces musulmans, l'Ayatolah Khomeini  a défendu avec des discours horripilants ces pratiques de pédophilie :Un homme peut obtenir un plaisir sexuel d'une jeune enfant et même d'un bébé. En revanche, il ne peut la pénétrer mais la sodomiser  : SANS PROBLÈME.Ceci n'est malheureusement pas assez relaté et le MONDE se tait ou ne veut pas voir. Pire encore, on ne veut pas qu'IL SACHE.À présent vous êtes au courant ! Allez-vous rester muets ?Si vous ne faites rien, personne ne pourra sauver ces innocentes petites victimes du Hamas et autres...",

That's an exceedingly odd number. Why was that gauge used?  Because that's the way they built them in England, and the US railroads were built by English expatriates.  Why did the English build them like that? Because the first rail lines were built by the same people who built the pre-railroad tramways, and that's the gauge they used.  Why did they use that gauge then? Because the people who built the tramways used the same jigs and tools that they used for building wagons which used that wheel spacing.  Okay! Why did the wagons have that particular odd wheel spacing? Well, if they tried to use any other spacing, the wagon wheels would break on some of the old, long distance roads in England, because that's the spacing of the wheel ruts.  So who built those old rutted roads? The first long distance roads in Europe (and England) were built by Imperial Rome for their legions. The roads have been used ever since. And the ruts in the roads? Roman war chariots first formed the initial ruts, which everyone else had to match for fear of destroying their wagon wheels. Since the chariots were made for (or by) Imperial Rome, they were all alike in the matter of wheel spacing.  The United States standard railroad gauge of 4 feet, 8.5 inches derives from the original specification for an Imperial Roman war chariot. Specifications and bureaucracies live forever. So the next time you are handed a specification and wonder what horse's ass came up with it, you may be exactly right, because the Imperial Roman war chariots were made just wide enough to accommodate the back ends of two war horses. Thus, we have the answer to the original question.  Now the twist to the story . . .  There's an interesting extension to the story about railroad gauges and horses' behinds. When we see a Space Shuttle sitting on its launch pad, there are two big booster rockets attached to the sides of the main fuel tank. These are solid rocket boosters, or SRBs. The SRBs are made by Thiokol at their factory in Utah. The engineers who designed the SRBs might have preferred to make them a bit fatter, but the SRBs had to be shipped by train from the factory to the launch site. The railroad line from the factory had to run through a tunnel in the mountains. The SRBs had to fit through that tunnel. The tunnel is slightly wider than the railroad track, and the railroad track is about as wide as two horses' behinds. So, the major design feature of what is arguably the world's most advanced transportation system was determined over two thousand years ago by the width of a Horse's Ass!",

For some of us, this may be our only chance to confirm the demise of the man who is solely responsible for turning the American people away from liberal philosophy. As Democrats, we need to put small differences aside and be certain that this man is truly gone. Next, we must reclaim our country from the church-goers, the middle America folks and the uneducated conservative masses.",

The CDC says H1N1 is currently wiping out entire villages in Asia . They expect it to hit the US in Jan/Feb where it will kill 6 out of 10 people. It HAS mutated. (Throw out the conspiracy theory) They will attempt a program of mandatory vaccinations but probably will not have enough time to enforce it. I will not be vaccinated. The last time they did mandatory vaccinations at least one person died and many others developed Guillain-Barré syndrome, which is a devastating illness.  They have not let the public know because they don’t want people to panic, but to people who know, they are suggesting the following:  Start stocking up on food now. They expect that martial law will be put into effect. You won't be able to go to work or shop for food — you will be shot.  Buy facial masks made by 3M - #N95.  Use Purell obsessively.  Oh, this is interesting: This pandemic was predicted years ago by a Russian mathematician. It's impetus was the Tsunami a few years ago.  I know that by spreading this information I'm taking the risk of looking like an alarmist, but this is straight from the mouths of the CDC and Johns Hopkins.",

        "tweet": "C’est le très sérieux magazine économique néerlandais Quote qui a révélé l’information le 9 janvier dernier. Le journal allemand NeoPresse s’en ai fait l’écho le 19 janvier 2014. En effet, selon les sources citées ci-dessus, l’hebdomadaire satirique Charlie Hebdo aurait été racheté en décembre 2014 par la famille Rothschild. Le magazine économique néerlandais Quote nous indique : Les Rothschild impriment Charlie Hebdo : « On avait des doutes concernant la publication de ce journal » La France est toute retournée après les violentes attaques contre Charlie Hebdo et les événements spectaculaires qui ont suivi. Le quotidien Libération, où l’hebdomadaire satirique à paraître les prochaines semaines est heureusement encore produit, a récemment été acquis par une illustre famille de banquiers : les Rothschild. Cependant, cette acquisition a fait l’objet d’une discussion au sein de la famille Rothschild, d’après le baron Philippe de Rothschild, qui a récemment accordé un entretien exclusif à Quote publié en janvier. « Il y a eu une discussion concernant le rachat effectué par mon oncle Édouard, le baron de Rothschild », déclare Philippe. « Certains membres de la famille voulaient empêcher cette acquisition, car cet hebdomadaire nous aurait donné un pouvoir politique. Nous voulions éviter à tout prix cela. Nous ne voulons absolument pas nous mêler de politique, ou en tout cas, pas de façon si apparente. Pour finir, cette réticence dans la famille s’est estompée ». Le baron Philippe de Rothschild nous apprend ici que sa famille a fait l’acquisition du journal satirique Charlie Hebdo au mois de décembre 2014. Certes, ce choix ne faisait apparemment pas l’unanimité au sein de la pègre, d’après les dires de Philippe. En effet, comme il nous l’explique si bien, le problème n’était pas vraiment sur le fond mais plutôt sur la forme , toujours selon les propos de Philippe, la famille ne souhaitait absolument pas se mêler de politique, ou en tout cas, pas de façon si apparente. Traduction : On vous glisse des Quenelles mais on ne pensait pas que vous le sauriez ! L’article de Quote se termine sur un renvoi vers l’entretien intégral donné par le baron au même journal (sa version papier) et intitulé : « Le peuple sera toujours jaloux« . Seul un cerveau malade pourrait penser qu’il existe un lien de cause à effet quelconque entre cette acquisition par un bienfaiteur qui tient la population en estime et avec, quelques semaines plus tard, « l’attentat » survenu le 7 janvier 2015. D’autant plus que ce dernier a « permis » au journal de multiplier ses ventes par plus de cent, passant des 60 000 tirages habituels et péniblement vendus à 7 000 000 écoulés en quelques heures en France et à l’international. Évidemment, il serait tout à fait incongru de penser que des gens puissent en faire tuer d’autres simplement pour obtenir argent et pouvoir. Voyons, restons raisonnables… ne propageons pas des théories conspirationnistes ! D’autres esprits tordus ont déjà par le passé souligné l’étrange coïncidence entre l’acquisition du bail des tours jumelles du Wold Trade Center par Larry Silverstein, à l’été 2001, et les « attentats » du 11-Septembre, de la même année. D’autant plus que l’individu a fait modifier son contrat d’assurance six semaines avant le 11 septembre 2001 pour couvrir ses tours contre d’éventuels attentats terroristes. Hasard… ou réalité scientifique ?",

Through a closely held equity fund called Solamere, Mitt Romney and his wife, son and brother are major investors in an investment firm called H.I.G. Capital. H.I.G. in turn holds a majority share and three out of five board members in Hart Intercivic, a company that owns the notoriously faulty electronic voting machines that will count the ballots in swing state Ohio November 7. Hart machines will also be used elsewhere in the United States.  In other words, a candidate for the presidency of the United States, and his brother, wife and son, have a straight-line financial interest in the voting machines that could decide this fall's election.

He's a couple of days in when he is stopped for speeding. He fumbles in the glove compartment for his registration, and the flask falls out onto the seat.  Boy, intones the officer, Is that liquor? Have you been drinking?  No, sir, it's not alcohol.  I think you're drunk — lemme see that. The officer picks up the flask, unscrews the top, and takes a swig. Well, I guess it's not liquor, but I'm gonna have to write you up for speeding.  The officer goes back to his car. Since the guy has out-of-state plates, he figures it'll be a while until the guy gets the results of the computer check. Fifteen minutes pass, then twenty, then nearly thirty. The guy musters up the courage to look back at the cop, and sees him staring off into space. As quietly as possible, he starts his car and drives off.    Collected on the Internet, 1999] Apparently, a bunch of guys were driving through the Nevada desert taking hits from a solution of LSD dissolved in a large jar of water. Eventually they were pulled over by a state trooper for erratic driving. The cop lectures the guys in the car, then, it being a hot day, demands a drink from their jar of water. He drinks, and immediately ingests thousands of hits of LSD and goes insane.",

Are we fighting a war on terror or aren't we? Was it or was it not started by Islamic people who brought it to our shores on September 11, 2001? Were people from all over the world, mostly Americans, not brutally murdered that day, in downtown Manhattan, across the Potomac from our nation's capitol and in a field in Pennsylvania? Did nearly three thousand men, women and children die a horrible, burning or crushing death that day, or didn't they?  And I'm supposed to care that a copy of the Koran was desecrated when an overworked American soldier kicked it or got it wet? Well, I don't. I don't care at all!  I'll start caring when Osama bin Laden turns himself in and repents for incinerating all those innocent people on 9/11.  I'll care about the Koran when the fanatics in the Middle East start caring about the Holy Bible, the mere possession of which is a crime in Saudi Arabia.  I'll care when Abu Musab al-Zarqawi tells the world he is sorry for hacking off Nick Berg's head while Berg screamed through his gurgling, slashed throat.  I'll care when the cowardly so-called insurgents in Iraq come out and fight like men instead of disrespecting their own religion by hiding in mosques.  I'll care when the mindless zealots who blow themselves up in search of nirvana care about the innocent children within range of their suicide bombs.  I'll care when the American media stops pretending that their First Amendment liberties are somehow derived from international law instead of the United States Constitution's Bill of Rights.  I'll care when Clinton-appointed judges stop ordering my government to release photos of the abuses at Abu Ghraib, which are sure to set off the Islamic extremists just as Newsweek's lies did a few weeks ago.  In the meantime, when I hear a story about a brave marine roughing up an Iraqi terrorist to obtain information, know this: I don't care.  When I see a fuzzy photo of a pile of naked Iraqi prisoners who have been humiliated in what amounts to a college hazing incident, rest assured that I don't care.  When I see a wounded terrorist get shot in the head when he is told not to move because he might be booby-trapped, you can take it to the bank that I don't care.  When I hear that a prisoner, who was issued a Koran and a prayer mat, and fed special food that is paid for by my tax dollars, is complaining that his holy book is being mishandled, you can absolutely believe in your heart of hearts that I don't care.  And oh, by the way, I've noticed that sometimes it's spelled Koran and other times Quran. Well, Jimmy Crack Corn and — you guessed it — I don't care!

He said if such a thing happens, we wouldn't be able to count on the support of France. I told him that it didn't surprise me. Since we had come to France's rescue in World War I, World War II, Vietnam, and the Cold War, their ingratitude and jealousy was due to surface at some point in the near future anyway. That is why, I said softly, France is a third-rate military power with a socialist economy and a bunch of faggots for soldiers. I additionally told him that America, being a nation of deeds and action, not words, would do whatever it had to do, and France's support was only for show anyway. Just like in ALL NATO exercises, the U.S. would shoulder 85% of the burden, as evidenced by the fact that the French officer was shopping in the American PX, and not the other way around.  He began to get belligerent at that point, and I told him if he would like to, I would meet him outside in front of the Burger King and beat his ass in front of the entire Multinational Brigade East, thus demonstrating that even the smallest American had more fight in him than the average Frenchman.  He called me a barbarian cowboy and walked away in a huff. With friends like these, who needs enemies?",
